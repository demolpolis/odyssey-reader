    "text": "Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\ndriven time and again off course, once he had plundered\nthe hallowed heights of Troy.\nMany cities of men he saw and learned their minds,\nmany pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,\nfighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.\nBut he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove —\nthe recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,\nthe blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun\n10  and the Sungod wiped from sight the day of their return.\nLaunch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,\nstart from where you will —sing for our time too.\nall the survivors, all who avoided headlong death\nwere safe at home, escaped the wars and waves.\nBut one man alone . . .\nhis heart set on his wife and his return —Calypso,\nthe bewitching nymph, the lustrous goddess, held him back,\ndeep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband.\nBut then, when the wheeling seasons brought the year around,\nthat year spun out by the gods when he should reach his home,\nIthaca —though not even there would he be free of trials,\neven among his loved ones —then every god took pity,\nall except Poseidon. He raged on, seething against\nthe great Odysseus till he reached his native land.\nPoseidon had gone to visit the Ethiopians worlds away,\nEthiopians off at the farthest limits of mankind,\na people split in two, one part where the Sungod sets\nand part where the Sungod rises. There Poseidon went\nto receive an offering, bulls and rams by the hundred —\n30  far away at the feast the Sea-lord sat and took his pleasure.\nBut the other gods, at home in Olympian Zeus’s halls,\nmet for full assembly there, and among them now\nthe father of men and gods was first to speak,\nsorely troubled, remembering handsome Aegisthus,\nthe man Agamemnon’s son, renowned Orestes, killed.\nRecalling Aegisthus, Zeus harangued the immortal powers:\n“Ah how shameless —the way these mortals blame the gods.\nFrom us alone, they say, come all their miseries, yes,\nbut they themselves, with their own reckless ways,\ncompound their pains beyond their proper share.\nLook at Aegisthus now . . .\nabove and beyond his share he stole Atrides’ wife,\nhe murdered the warlord coming home from Troy\nthough he knew it meant his own total ruin.\nFar in advance we told him so ourselves,\ndispatching the guide, the giant-killer Hermes.\n‘Don’t murder the man,’ he said, ‘don’t court his wife.\nBeware, revenge will come from Orestes, Agamemnon’s son,\nthat day he comes of age and longs for his native land.’\n50  So Hermes warned, with all the good will in the world,\nbut would Aegisthus’ hardened heart give way?\nNow he pays the price —all at a single stroke.”\nAnd sparkling-eyed Athena drove the matter home:\n“Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king,\nsurely he goes down to a death he earned in full!\nLet them all die so, all who do such things.\nBut my heart breaks for Odysseus,\nthat seasoned veteran cursed by fate so long —\nfar from his loved ones still, he suffers torments\n60  off on a wave-washed island rising at the center of the seas.\nA dark wooded island, and there a goddess makes her home,\na daughter of Atlas, wicked Titan who sounds the deep\nin all its depths, whose shoulders lift on high\nthe colossal pillars thrusting earth and sky apart.\nAtlas’ daughter it is who holds Odysseus captive,\nluckless man —despite his tears, forever trying\nto spellbind his heart with suave, seductive words\nand wipe all thought of Ithaca from his mind.\nBut he, straining for no more than a glimpse\n70  of hearth-smoke drifting up from his own land,\nOdysseus longs to die . . .\nOlympian Zeus,\nhave you no care for him in your lofty heart?\nDid he never win your favor with sacrifices\nburned beside the ships on the broad plain of Troy?\nWhy, Zeus, why so dead set against Odysseus?”\n“My child,” Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied,\n“what nonsense you let slip through your teeth. Now,\nhow on earth could I forget Odysseus? Great Odysseus\nwho excels all men in wisdom, excels in offerings too\n80  he gives the immortal gods who rule the vaulting skies?\nNo, it’s the Earth-Shaker, Poseidon, unappeased,\nforever fuming against him for the Cyclops\nwhose giant eye he blinded: godlike Polyphemus,\ntowering over all the Cyclops’ clans in power.\nThe nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys,\nlord of the barren salt sea —she met Poseidon\nonce in his vaulted caves and they made love.\nAnd now for his blinded son the earthquake god —\nthough he won’t quite kill Odysseus —\n90  drives him far off course from native land.\nBut come, all of us here put heads together now,\nwork out his journey home so Odysseus can return.\nLord Poseidon, I trust, will let his anger go.\nHow can he stand his ground against the will\nof all the gods at once —one god alone?”\nAthena, her eyes flashing bright, exulted,\n“Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king!\nIf now it really pleases the blissful gods\nthat wise Odysseus shall return —home at last —\n100  let us dispatch the guide and giant-killer Hermes\ndown to Ogygia Island, down to announce at once\nto the nymph with lovely braids our fixed decree:\nOdysseus journeys home —the exile must return!\nWhile I myself go down to Ithaca, rouse his son\nto a braver pitch, inspire his heart with courage\nto summon the flowing-haired Achaeans to full assembly,\nspeak his mind to all those suitors, slaughtering on and on\nhis droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle.\nNext I will send him off to Sparta and sandy Pylos,\n110  there to learn of his dear father’s journey home.\nPerhaps he will hear some news and make his name\nthroughout the mortal world.”\nSo Athena vowed\nand under her feet she fastened the supple sandals,\never-glowing gold, that wing her over the waves\nand boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds.\nShe seized the rugged spear tipped with a bronze point —\nweighted, heavy, the massive shaft she wields to break the lines\nof heroes the mighty Father’s daughter storms against.\nAnd down she swept from Olympus’ craggy peaks\n120  and lit on Ithaca, standing tall at Odysseus’ gates,\nthe threshold of his court. Gripping her bronze spear,\nshe looked for all the world like a stranger now,\nlike Mentes, lord of the Taphians.\nThere she found the swaggering suitors, just then\namusing themselves with rolling dice before the doors,\nlounging on hides of oxen they had killed themselves.\nWhile heralds and brisk attendants bustled round them,\nsome at the mixing-bowls, mulling wine and water,\nothers wiping the tables down with sopping sponges,\n130  setting them out in place, still other servants\njointed and carved the great sides of meat.\nFirst by far to see her was Prince Telemachus,\nsitting among the suitors, heart obsessed with grief.\nHe could almost see his magnificent father, here . . .\nin the mind’s eye —if only he might drop from the clouds\nand drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls\nand regain his pride of place and rule his own domains!\nDaydreaming so as he sat among the suitors,\nhe glimpsed Athena now\n140  and straight to the porch he went, mortified\nthat a guest might still be standing at the doors.\nPausing beside her there, he clasped her right hand\nand relieving her at once of her long bronze spear,\nmet her with winged words: “Greetings, stranger!\nHere in our house you’ll find a royal welcome.\nHave supper first, then tell us what you need.”\nHe led the way and Pallas Athena followed.\nOnce in the high-roofed hall, he took her lance\nand fixed it firm in a burnished rack against\n150  a sturdy pillar, there where row on row of spears,\nembattled Odysseus’ spears, stood stacked and waiting.\nThen he escorted her to a high, elaborate chair of honor,\nover it draped a cloth, and here he placed his guest\nwith a stool to rest her feet. But for himself\nhe drew up a low reclining chair beside her,\nrichly painted, clear of the press of suitors,\nconcerned his guest, offended by their uproar,\nmight shrink from food in the midst of such a mob.\nHe hoped, what’s more, to ask her about his long-lost father.\n160  A maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher\nand over a silver basin tipped it out\nso they might rinse their hands,\nthen pulled a gleaming table to their side.\nA staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them,\nappetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.\nA carver lifted platters of meat toward them,\nmeats of every sort, and set beside them golden cups\nand time and again a page came round and poured them wine.\nBut now the suitors trooped in with all their swagger\n170  and took their seats on low and high-backed chairs.\nHeralds poured water over their hands for rinsing,\nserving maids brought bread heaped high in trays\nand the young men brimmed the mixing-bowls with wine.\nThey reached out for the good things that lay at hand,\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink\nthe suitors set their minds on other pleasures,\nsong and dancing, all that crowns a feast.\nA herald placed an ornate lyre in Phemius’ hands,\nthe bard who always performed among them there;\nthey forced the man to sing.\n180                               A rippling prelude —\nand no sooner had he struck up his rousing song\nthan Telemachus, head close to Athena’s sparkling eyes,\nspoke low to his guest so no one else could hear:\n“Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what I say?\nLook at them over there. Not a care in the world,\njust lyres and tunes! It’s easy for them, all right,\nthey feed on another’s goods and go scot-free —\na man whose white bones lie strewn in the rain somewhere,\nrotting away on land or rolling down the ocean’s salty swells.\n190  But that man —if they caught sight of him home in Ithaca,\nby god, they’d all pray to be faster on their feet\nthan richer in bars of gold and heavy robes.\nBut now, no use, he’s died a wretched death.\nNo comfort’s left for us . . . not even if\nsomeone, somewhere, says he’s coming home.\nThe day of his return will never dawn.\nTell me about yourself now, clearly, point by point.\nWho are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?\nWhat sort of vessel brought you? Why did the sailors\n200  land you here in Ithaca? Who did they say they are?\nI hardly think you came this way on foot!\nAnd tell me this for a fact —I need to know —\nis this your first time here? Or are you a friend of father’s,\na guest from the old days? Once, crowds of other men\nwould come to our house on visits —visitor that he was,\nwhen he walked among the living.”\nHer eyes glinting,\ngoddess Athena answered, “My whole story, of course,\nI’ll tell it point by point. Wise old Anchialus\nwas my father. My own name is Mentes,\n210  lord of the Taphian men who love their oars.\nAnd here I’ve come, just now, with ship and crew,\nsailing the wine-dark sea to foreign ports of call,\nto Temese, out for bronze —our cargo gleaming iron.\nOur ship lies moored off farmlands far from town,\nriding in Rithron Cove, beneath Mount Nion’s woods.\nAs for the ties between your father and myself,\nwe’ve been friends forever, I’m proud to say,\nand he would bear me out\nif you went and questioned old lord Laertes.\n220  He, I gather, no longer ventures into town\nbut lives a life of hardship, all to himself,\noff on his farmstead with an aged serving-woman\nwho tends him well, who gives him food and drink\nwhen weariness has taken hold of his withered limbs\nfrom hauling himself along his vineyard’s steep slopes.\nAnd now I’ve come —and why? I heard that he was back . . .\nyour father, that is. But no, the gods thwart his passage.\nYet I tell you great Odysseus is not dead. He’s still alive,\nsomewhere in this wide world, held captive, out at sea\n230  on a wave-washed island, and hard men, savages,\nsomehow hold him back against his will.\nI’ll make you a prophecy, one the immortal gods\nhave planted in my mind —it will come true, I think,\nthough I am hardly a seer or know the flights of birds.\nHe won’t be gone long from the native land he loves,\nnot even if iron shackles bind your father down.\nHe’s plotting a way to journey home at last;\nhe’s never at a loss.\nBut come, please,\ntell me about yourself now, point by point.\n240  You’re truly Odysseus’ son? You’ve sprung up so!\nUncanny resemblance . . . the head, and the fine eyes —\nI see him now. How often we used to meet in the old days\nbefore he embarked for Troy, where other Argive captains,\nall the best men, sailed in the long curved ships.\nFrom then to this very day\nI’ve not set eyes on Odysseus or he on me.”\nAnd young Telemachus cautiously replied,\n“I’ll try, my friend, to give you a frank answer.\nMother has always told me I’m his son, it’s true,\n250  but I am not so certain. Who, on his own,\nhas ever really known who gave him life?\nWould to god I’d been the son of a happy man\nwhom old age overtook in the midst of his possessions!\nNow, think of the most unlucky mortal ever born —\nsince you ask me, yes, they say I am his son.”\n“Still,” the clear-eyed goddess reassured him,\n“trust me, the gods have not marked out your house\nfor such an unsung future,\nnot if Penelope has borne a son like you.\n260  But tell me about all this and spare me nothing.\nWhat’s this banqueting, this crowd carousing here?\nAnd what part do you play yourself? Some wedding-feast,\nsome festival? Hardly a potluck supper, I would say.\nHow obscenely they lounge and swagger here, look,\ngorging in your house. Why, any man of sense\nwho chanced among them would be outraged,\nseeing such behavior.”\nReady Telemachus\ntook her up at once: “Well, my friend,\nseeing you want to probe and press the question,\n270  once this house was rich, no doubt, beyond reproach\nwhen the man you mentioned still lived here, at home.\nNow the gods have reversed our fortunes with a vengeance —\nwiped that man from the earth like no one else before.\nI would never have grieved so much about his death\nif he’d gone down with comrades off in Troy\nor died in the arms of loved ones,\nonce he had wound down the long coil of war.\nThen all united Achaea would have raised his tomb\nand he’d have won his son great fame for years to come.\n280  But now the whirlwinds have ripped him away, no fame for him!\nHe’s lost and gone now —out of sight, out of mind —and I . . .\nhe’s left me tears and grief. Nor do I rack my heart\nand grieve for him alone. No longer. Now the gods\nhave invented other miseries to plague me.\nAll the nobles who rule the islands round about,\nDulichion, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus too,\nand all who lord it in rocky Ithaca as well —\ndown to the last man they court my mother,\nthey lay waste my house! And mother . . .\nshe neither rejects a marriage she despises\nnor can she bear to bring the courting to an end —\nwhile they continue to bleed my household white.\nSoon —you wait —they’ll grind me down as well.”\n“Shameful!” —\nbrimming with indignation, Pallas Athena broke out.\n“Oh how much you need Odysseus, gone so long —\nhow he’d lay hands on all these brazen suitors!\nIf only he would appear, now,\nat his house’s outer gates and take his stand,\narmed with his helmet, shield and pair of spears,\n300  as strong as the man I glimpsed that first time\nin our own house, drinking wine and reveling there . . .\njust come in from Ephyra, visiting Ilus, Mermerus’ son.\nOdysseus sailed that way, you see, in his swift trim ship,\nhunting deadly poison to smear on his arrows’ bronze heads.\nIlus refused —he feared the wrath of the everlasting gods —\nbut father, so fond of him, gave him all he wanted.\nIf only that Odysseus sported with these suitors,\na blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot!\nTrue, but all lies in the lap of the great gods,\n310  whether or not he’ll come and pay them back,\nhere, in his own house.\nBut you, I urge you,\nthink how to drive these suitors from your halls.\nCome now, listen closely. Take my words to heart.\nAt daybreak summon the island’s lords to full assembly,\ngive your orders to all and call the gods to witness:\ntell the suitors to scatter, each to his own place.\nAs for your mother, if the spirit moves her to marry,\nlet her go back to her father’s house, a man of power.\nHer kin will arrange the wedding, provide the gifts,\nthe array that goes with a daughter dearly loved.\n320                                                      For you,\nI have some good advice, if only you will accept it.\nFit out a ship with twenty oars, the best in sight,\nsail in quest of news of your long-lost father.\nSomeone may tell you something\nor you may catch a rumor straight from Zeus,\nrumor that carries news to men like nothing else.\nFirst go down to Pylos, question old King Nestor,\nthen cross over to Sparta, to red-haired Menelaus,\nof all the bronze-armored Achaeans the last man back.\n330  Now, if you hear your father’s alive and heading home,\nhard-pressed as you are, brave out one more year.\nIf you hear he’s dead, no longer among the living,\nthen back you come to the native land you love,\nraise his grave-mound, build his honors high\nwith the full funeral rites that he deserves —\nand give your mother to another husband.\nonce you’ve sealed those matters, seen them through,\nthink hard, reach down deep in your heart and soul\nfor a way to kill these suitors in your house,\n340  by stealth or in open combat.\nYou must not cling to your boyhood any longer —\nit’s time you were a man. Haven’t you heard\nwhat glory Prince Orestes won throughout the world\nwhen he killed that cunning, murderous Aegisthus,\nwho’d killed his famous father?\nAnd you, my friend —\nhow tall and handsome I see you now —be brave, you too,\nso men to come will sing your praises down the years.\nBut now I must go back to my swift trim ship\nand all my shipmates, chafing there, I’m sure,\n350  waiting for my return. It all rests with you.\nTake my words to heart.”\n“Oh stranger,”\nheedful Telemachus replied, “indeed I will.\nYou’ve counseled me with so much kindness now,\nlike a father to a son. I won’t forget a word.\nBut come, stay longer, keen as you are to sail,\nso you can bathe and rest and lift your spirits,\nthen go back to your ship, delighted with a gift,\na prize of honor, something rare and fine\nas a keepsake from myself. The kind of gift\n360  a host will give a stranger, friend to friend.”\nHer eyes glinting, Pallas declined in haste:\n“Not now. Don’t hold me here. I long to be on my way.\nAs for the gift —whatever you’d give in kindness —\nsave it for my return so I can take it home.\nChoose something rare and fine, and a good reward\nthat gift is going to bring you.”\nWith that promise,\noff and away Athena the bright-eyed goddess flew\nlike a bird in soaring flight\nbut left his spirit filled with nerve and courage,\n370  charged with his father’s memory more than ever now.\nHe felt his senses quicken, overwhelmed with wonder —\nthis was a god, he knew it well and made at once\nfor the suitors, a man like a god himself.\nAmidst them still\nthe famous bard sang on, and they sat in silence, listening\nas he performed The Achaeans’ Journey Home from Troy:\nall the blows Athena doomed them to endure.\nfrom high above in her room and deep in thought,\nshe caught his inspired strains . . .\nIcarius’ daughter Penelope, wary and reserved,\n380  and down the steep stair from her chamber she descended,\nnot alone: two of her women followed close behind.\nThat radiant woman, once she reached her suitors,\ndrawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,\npaused now where a column propped the sturdy roof,\nwith one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side.\nSuddenly, dissolving in tears and bursting through\nthe bard’s inspired voice, she cried out, “Phemius!\nSo many other songs you know to hold us spellbound,\nworks of the gods and men that singers celebrate.\n390  Sing one of those as you sit beside them here\nand they drink their wine in silence.\nBut break off this song —\nthe unendurable song that always rends the heart inside me . . .\nthe unforgettable grief, it wounds me most of all!\nHow I long for my husband —alive in memory, always,\nthat great man whose fame resounds through Hellas\nright to the depths of Argos!”\n“Why, mother,”\npoised Telemachus put in sharply, “why deny\nour devoted bard the chance to entertain us\nany way the spirit stirs him on?\n400  Bards are not to blame —\nZeus is to blame. He deals to each and every\nlaborer on this earth whatever doom he pleases.\nWhy fault the bard if he sings the Argives’ harsh fate?\nIt’s always the latest song, the one that echoes last\nin the listeners’ ears, that people praise the most.\nCourage, mother. Harden your heart, and listen.\nOdysseus was scarcely the only one, you know,\nwhose journey home was blotted out at Troy.\nOthers, so many others, died there too.\nSo, mother,\n410  go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks,\nthe distaff and the loom, and keep the women\nworking hard as well. As for giving orders,\nmen will see to that, but I most of all:\nI hold the reins of power in this house.”\nAstonished,\nshe withdrew to her own room. She took to heart\nthe clear good sense in what her son had said.\nClimbing up to the lofty chamber with her women,\nshe fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,\ntill watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep.\n420    But the suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls,\nall of them lifting prayers to lie beside her, share her bed,\nuntil discreet Telemachus took command: “You suitors\nwho plague my mother, you, you insolent, overweening . . .\nfor this evening let us dine and take our pleasure,\nno more shouting now. What a fine thing it is\nto listen to such a bard as we have here —\nthe man sings like a god.\nBut at first light\nwe all march forth to assembly, take our seats\nso I can give my orders and say to you straight out:\nYou must leave my palace! See to your feasting elsewhere,\ndevour your own possessions, house to house by turns.\nBut if you decide the fare is better, richer here,\ndestroying one man’s goods and going scot-free,\nall right then, carve away!\nBut I’ll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes\nthat Zeus will pay you back with a vengeance —all of you\ndestroyed in my house while I go scot-free myself!”\nSo Telemachus declared. And they all bit their lips,\namazed the prince could speak with so much daring.\nEupithes’ son Antinous broke their silence:\n“Well, Telemachus, only the gods could teach you\nto sound so high and mighty! Such brave talk.\nI pray that Zeus will never make you king of Ithaca,\nthough your father’s crown is no doubt yours by birth.”\nBut cool-headed Telemachus countered firmly:\n“Antinous, even though my words may offend you,\nI’d be happy to take the crown if Zeus presents it.\nYou think that nothing worse could befall a man?\nIt’s really not so bad to be a king. All at once\n450  your palace grows in wealth, your honors grow as well.\nBut there are hosts of other Achaean princes, look —\nyoung and old, crowds of them on our island here —\nand any one of the lot might hold the throne,\nnow great Odysseus is dead . . .\nBut I’ll be lord of my own house and servants,\nall that King Odysseus won for me by force.”\nAnd now Eurymachus, Polybus’ son, stepped in:\n“Surely this must lie in the gods’ lap, Telemachus —\nwhich Achaean will lord it over seagirt Ithaca.\n460  Do hold on to your own possessions, rule your house.\nGod forbid that anyone tear your holdings from your hands\nwhile men still live in Ithaca.\nBut about your guest,\ndear boy, I have some questions. Where does he come from?\nWhere’s his country, his birth, his father’s old estates?\nDid he bring some news of your father, his return?\nOr did he come on business of his own?\nHow he leapt to his feet and off he went!\nNo waiting around for proper introductions.\nAnd no mean man, not by the looks of him, I’d say.”\n470    “Eurymachus,” Telemachus answered shrewdly,\n“clearly my father’s journey home is lost forever.\nI no longer trust in rumors —rumors from the blue —\nnor bother with any prophecy, when mother calls\nsome wizard into the house to ask him questions.\nAs for the stranger, though,\nthe man’s an old family friend, from Taphos,\nwise Anchialus’ son. He says his name is Mentes,\nlord of the Taphian men who love their oars.”\nbut deep in his mind he knew the immortal goddess.\n480  Now the suitors turned to dance and song,\nto the lovely beat and sway,\nwaiting for dusk to come upon them there . . .\nand the dark night came upon them, lost in pleasure.\nFinally, to bed. Each to his own house.\nTelemachus,\noff to his bedroom built in the fine courtyard —\na commanding, lofty room set well apart —\nretired too, his spirit swarming with misgivings.\nHis devoted nurse attended him, bearing a glowing torch,\nEurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor’s son.\n490  Laertes had paid a price for the woman years ago,\nstill in the bloom of youth. He traded twenty oxen,\nhonored her on a par with his own loyal wife at home\nbut fearing the queen’s anger, never shared her bed.\nShe was his grandson’s escort now and bore a torch,\nfor she was the one of all the maids who loved\nthe prince the most —she’d nursed him as a baby.\nHe spread the doors of his snug, well-made room,\nsat down on the bed and pulled his soft shirt off,\ntossed it into the old woman’s conscientious hands,\n500  and after folding it neatly, patting it smooth,\nshe hung it up on a peg beside his corded bed,\nthen padded from the bedroom,\ndrawing the door shut with the silver hook,\nsliding the doorbolt home with its rawhide strap.\nThere all night long, wrapped in a sheep’s warm fleece,\nhe weighed in his mind the course Athena charted."

    "text": "When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthe true son of Odysseus sprang from bed and dressed,\nover his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword,\nfastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet\nand stepped from his bedroom, handsome as a god.\nAt once he ordered heralds to cry out loud and clear\nand summon the flowing-haired Achaeans to full assembly.\nTheir cries rang out. The people filed in quickly.\nWhen they’d grouped, crowding the meeting grounds,\n10  Telemachus strode in too, a bronze spear in his grip\nand not alone: two sleek hounds went trotting at his heels.\nAnd Athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince\nso the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward,\nthe elders making way as he took his father’s seat.\nThe first to speak was an old lord, Aegyptius,\nstooped with age, who knew the world by heart.\nFor one dear son had sailed with King Odysseus,\nbound in the hollow ships to the stallion-land of Troy —\nthe spearman Antiphus —but the brutal Cyclops killed him,\n20  trapped in his vaulted cave, the last man the monster ate.\nThree other sons he had: one who mixed with the suitors,\nEurynomus, and two kept working their father’s farms.\nStill, he never forgot the soldier, desolate in his grief.\nIn tears for the son he lost, he rose and said among them,\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what I have to say.\nNot once have we held assembly, met in session\nsince King Odysseus sailed away in the hollow ships.\nWho has summoned us now —one of the young men,\none of the old-timers? What crisis spurs him on?\n30  Some news he’s heard of an army on the march,\nword he’s caught firsthand so he can warn us now?\nOr some other public matter he’ll disclose and argue?\nHe’s a brave man, I’d say. God be with him, too!\nMay Zeus speed him on to a happy end,\nwhatever his heart desires!”\nWinning words\nwith a lucky ring. Odysseus’ son rejoiced;\nthe boy could sit no longer —fired up to speak,\nhe took his stand among the gathered men.\nThe herald Pisenor, skilled in custom’s ways,\n40  put the staff in his hand, and then the prince,\naddressing old Aegyptius first, led off with, “Sir,\nthat man is not far off —you’ll soon see for yourself —\nI was the one who called us all together.\nSomething wounds me deeply . . .\nnot news I’ve heard of an army on the march,\nword I’ve caught firsthand so I can warn you now,\nor some other public matter I’ll disclose and argue.\nNo, the crisis is my own. Trouble has struck my house —\na double blow. First, I have lost my noble father\n50  who ruled among you years ago, each of you here,\nand kindly as a father to his children.\nBut now this,\na worse disaster that soon will grind my house down,\nruin it all, and all my worldly goods in the bargain.\nSuitors plague my mother —against her will —\nsons of the very men who are your finest here!\nThey’d sooner die than approach her father’s house\nso Icarius himself might see to his daughter’s bridal,\nhand her to whom he likes, whoever meets his fancy.\nNot they —they infest our palace day and night,\n60  they butcher our cattle, our sheep, our fat goats,\nfeasting themselves sick, swilling our glowing wine\nas if there’s no tomorrow —all of it, squandered.\nNow we have no man like Odysseus in command\nto drive this curse from the house. We ourselves?\nWe’re hardly the ones to fight them off. All we’d do\nis parade our wretched weakness. A boy inept at battle.\nOh I’d swing to attack if I had the power in me.\nBy god, it’s intolerable, what they do —disgrace,\nmy house a shambles!\nYou should be ashamed yourselves,\n70  mortified in the face of neighbors living round about!\nFear the gods’ wrath —before they wheel in outrage\nand make these crimes recoil on your heads.\nI beg you by Olympian Zeus, by Themis too,\nwho sets assemblies free and calls us into session —\nstop, my friends! Leave me alone to pine away in anguish . . .\nUnless, of course, you think my noble father Odysseus\ndid the Achaean army damage, deliberate harm,\nand to pay me back you’d do me harm, deliberately\nsetting these parasites against me. Better for me\n80  if you were devouring all my treasure, all my cattle —\nif you were the ones, we’d make amends in no time.\nWe’d approach you for reparations round the town,\ndemanding our goods till you’d returned the lot.\nBut now, look, you load my heart with grief —\nthere’s nothing I can do!”\nFilled with anger,\ndown on the ground he dashed the speaker’s scepter —\nbursting into tears. Pity seized the assembly.\nAll just sat there, silent . . .\nno one had the heart to reply with harshness.\n90  Only Antinous, who found it in himself to say,\n“So high and mighty, Telemachus —such unbridled rage!\nWell now, fling your accusations at us?\nThink to pin the blame on us? You think again.\nIt’s not the suitors here who deserve the blame,\nit’s your own dear mother, the matchless queen of cunning.\nLook here. For three years now, getting on to four,\nshe’s played it fast and loose with all our hearts,\nbuilding each man’s hopes —\ndangling promises, dropping hints to each —\n100  but all the while with something else in mind.\nThis was her latest masterpiece of guile:\nshe set up a great loom in the royal halls\nand she began to weave, and the weaving finespun,\nthe yarns endless, and she would lead us on: ‘Young men,\nmy suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more,\ngo slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until\nI can finish off this web . . .\nso my weaving won’t all fray and come to nothing.\nThis is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day\n110  when the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down.\nI dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me,\nyes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state\nwithout a shroud for cover.’\nHer very words,\nand despite our pride and passion we believed her.\nSo by day she’d weave at her great and growing web —\nby night, by the light of torches set beside her,\nshe would unravel all she’d done. Three whole years\nshe deceived us blind, seduced us with this scheme . . .\nThen, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on,\n120  one of her women, in on the queen’s secret, told the truth\nand we caught her in the act —unweaving her gorgeous web.\nSo she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her.\nNow Telemachus, here is how the suitors answer you —\nyou burn it in your mind, you and all our people:\nsend your mother back! Direct her to marry\nwhomever her father picks, whoever pleases her.\nSo long as she persists in tormenting us,\nquick to exploit the gifts Athena gave her —\na skilled hand for elegant work, a fine mind\n130  and subtle wiles too —we’ve never heard the like,\nnot even in old stories sung of all Achaea’s\nwell-coifed queens who graced the years gone by:\nMycenae crowned with garlands, Tyro and Alcmena . . .\nNot one could equal Penelope for intrigue\nbut in this case she intrigued beyond all limits.\nSo, we will devour your worldly goods and wealth\nas long as she holds out, holds to that course\nthe gods have charted deep inside her heart.\nGreat renown she wins for herself, no doubt,\n140  great loss for you in treasure. We’ll not go back\nto our old estates or leave for other parts,\nnot till she weds the Argive man she fancies.”\nBut with calm good sense Telemachus replied:\n“Antinous, how can I drive my mother from our house\nagainst her will, the one who bore me, reared me too?\nMy father is worlds away, dead or alive, who knows?\nImagine the high price I’d have to pay Icarius\nif all on my own I send my mother home.\nOh what I would suffer from her father —\n150  and some dark god would hurt me even more\nwhen mother, leaving her own house behind,\ncalls down her withering Furies on my head,\nand our people’s cries of shame would hound my heels.\nI will never issue that ultimatum to my mother.\nAnd you, if you have any shame in your own hearts,\nyou must leave my palace! See to your feasting elsewhere,\ndevour your own possessions, house to house by turns.\nBut if you decide the fare is better, richer here,\ndestroying one man’s goods and going scot-free,\n160  all right then, carve away!\nBut I’ll cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes\nthat Zeus will pay you back with a vengeance —all of you\ndestroyed in my house while I go scot-free myself!”\nAnd to seal his prayer, farseeing Zeus sent down a sign.\nHe launched two eagles soaring high from a mountain ridge\nand down they glided, borne on the wind’s draft a moment,\nwing to wingtip, pinions straining taut till just\nabove the assembly’s throbbing hum they whirled,\nsuddenly, wings thrashing, wild onslaught of wings\n170  and banking down at the crowd’s heads —a glaring, fatal sign —\ntalons slashing each other, tearing cheeks and throats\nthey swooped away on the right through homes and city.\nAll were dumbstruck, watching the eagles trail from sight,\npeople brooding, deeply, what might come to pass . . .\nUntil the old warrior Halitherses,\nMastor’s son, broke the silence for them —\nthe one who outperformed all men of his time\nat reading bird-signs, sounding out the omens,\nrose and spoke, distraught for each man there:\n180  “Hear me, men of Ithaca! Hear what I have to say,\nthough my revelations strike the suitors first of all —\na great disaster is rolling like a breaker toward their heads.\nClearly Odysseus won’t be far from loved ones any longer —\nnow, right now, he’s somewhere near, I tell you,\nbreeding bloody death for all these suitors here,\npains aplenty too for the rest of us who live\nin Ithaca’s sunlit air.\nLong before that,\nwe must put heads together, find some way\nto stop these men, or let them stop themselves.\n190  Better for them that way, by far. I myself\nam no stranger to prophecy —I can see it now!\nOdysseus . . . all is working out for him, I say,\njust as I said it would that day the Argives sailed\nfor Troy and the mastermind of battle boarded with them.\nI said then: after many blows, and all his shipmates lost,\nafter twenty years had wheeled by, he would come home,\nunrecognized by all . . .\nand now, look, it all comes to pass!”\n“Stop, old man!”\nEurymachus, Polybus’ son, rose up to take him on.\n200  “Go home and babble your omens to your children —\nsave them from some catastrophe coming soon.\nI’m a better hand than you at reading portents.\nFlocks of birds go fluttering under the sun’s rays,\nnot all are fraught with meaning. Odysseus?\nHe’s dead now, far from home —\nwould to god that you’d died with him too.\nWe’d have escaped your droning prophecies then\nand the way you’ve loosed the dogs of this boy’s anger —\nyour eyes peeled for a house-gift he might give you.\n210  Here’s my prophecy, bound to come to pass.\nIf you, you old codger, wise as the ages,\ntalk him round, incite the boy to riot,\nhe’ll be the first to suffer, let me tell you.\nAnd you, old man, we’ll clap some fine on you\nyou’ll weep to pay, a fine to crush your spirit!\nTelemachus?\nHere in front of you all, here’s my advice for him.\nLet him urge his mother back to her father’s house —\nher kin will arrange the wedding, provide the gifts,\nthe array that goes with a daughter dearly loved.\n220  Not till then, I’d say, will the island princes quit\ntheir taxing courtship. Who’s there to fear? I ask you.\nSurely not Telemachus, with all his tiresome threats.\nNor do we balk, old man, at the prophecies you mouth —\nthey’ll come to grief, they’ll make us hate you more.\nThe prince’s wealth will be devoured as always,\nmercilessly —no reparations, ever . . . not\nwhile the queen drags out our hopes to wed her,\nwaiting, day after day, all of us striving hard\nto win one matchless beauty. Never courting others,\n230  bevies of brides who’d suit each noble here.”\nTelemachus answered, firm in his resolve:\n“Eurymachus —the rest of you fine, brazen suitors —\nI have done with appeals to you about these matters.\nI’ll say no more. The gods know how things stand\nand so do all the Achaeans. And now all I ask\nis a good swift ship and a crew of twenty men\nto speed me through my passage out and back.\nI’m sailing off to Sparta, sandy Pylos too,\nfor news of my long-lost father’s journey home.\n240  Someone may tell me something\nor I may catch a rumor straight from Zeus,\nrumor that carries news to men like nothing else.\nNow, if I hear my father’s alive and heading home,\nhard-pressed as I am, I’ll brave out one more year.\nIf I hear he’s dead, no longer among the living,\nthen back I’ll come to the native land I love,\nraise his grave-mound, build his honors high\nwith the full funeral rites that he deserves —\nand give my mother to another husband.”\nA declaration,\nand the prince sat down as Mentor took the floor,\nOdysseus’ friend-in-arms to whom the king,\nsailing off to Troy, committed his household,\nordering one and all to obey the old man\nand he would keep things steadfast and secure.\nWith deep concern for the realm, he rose and warned,\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what I have to say.\nNever let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now,\nnot with all his heart, or set his mind on justice —\nno, let him be cruel and always practice outrage.\n260  Think: not one of the people whom he ruled\nremembers Odysseus now, that godlike man,\nand kindly as a father to his children!\nI don’t grudge these arrogant suitors for a moment,\nweaving their violent work with all their wicked hearts —\nthey lay their lives on the line when they consume\nOdysseus’ worldly goods, blind in their violence,\ntelling themselves that he’ll come home no more.\nBut all the rest of you, how you rouse my fury!\nSitting here in silence . . .\n270  never a word put forth to curb these suitors,\npaltry few as they are and you so many.”\nEuenor’s son Leocritus rounded on him, shouting,\n“Rabble-rousing fool, now what’s this talk?\nGoading them on to try and hold us back!\nIt’s uphill work, I warn you,\nfighting a force like ours —for just a meal.\nEven if Odysseus of Ithaca did arrive in person,\nto find us well-bred suitors feasting in his halls,\nand the man were hell-bent on routing us from the palace —\n280  little joy would his wife derive from his return,\nfor all her yearning. Here on the spot he’d meet\na humiliating end if he fought against such odds.\nYou’re talking nonsense —idiocy.\nNo more. Come,\ndissolve the assembly. Each man return to his holdings.\nMentor and Halitherses can speed our young prince on,\nhis father’s doddering friends since time began.\nHe’ll sit tight a good long while, I trust,\nscrabbling for news right here in Ithaca —\nhe’ll never make that trip.”\n290    This broke up the assembly, keen to leave.\nThe people scattered quickly, each to his own house,\nwhile the suitors strolled back to King Odysseus’ palace.\nTelemachus, walking the beach now, far from others,\nwashed his hands in the foaming surf and prayed to Pallas:\n“Dear god, hear me! Yesterday you came to my house,\nyou told me to ship out on the misty sea and learn\nif father, gone so long, is ever coming home . . .\nLook how my countrymen —the suitors most of all,\nthe pernicious bullies —foil each move I make.”\n300    Athena came to his prayer from close at hand,\nfor all the world with Mentor’s build and voice,\nand she urged him on with winging words: “Telemachus,\nyou’ll lack neither courage nor sense from this day on,\nnot if your father’s spirit courses through your veins —\nnow there was a man, I’d say, in words and action both!\nSo how can your journey end in shipwreck or defeat?\nOnly if you were not his stock, Penelope’s too,\nthen I’d fear your hopes might come to grief.\nFew sons are the equals of their fathers;\n310  most fall short, all too few surpass them.\nBut you, brave and adept from this day on —\nOdysseus’ cunning has hardly given out in you —\nthere’s every hope that you will reach your goal.\nPut them out of your mind, these suitors’ schemes and plots.\nThey’re madmen. Not a shred of sense or decency in the crowd.\nNor can they glimpse the death and black doom hovering\njust at their heads to crush them all in one short day.\nBut you, the journey that stirs you now is not far off,\nnot with the likes of me, your father’s friend and yours,\n320  to rig you a swift ship and be your shipmate too.\nNow home you go and mix with the suitors there.\nBut get your rations ready,\npack them all in vessels, the wine in jars,\nand barley-meal —the marrow of men’s bones —\nin durable skins, while I make rounds in town\nand quickly enlist your crew of volunteers.\nLots of ships in seagirt Ithaca, old and new.\nI’ll look them over, choose the best in sight,\nwe’ll fit her out and launch her into the sea at once!”\n330    And so Athena, daughter of Zeus, assured him.\nNo lingering now —he heard the goddess’ voice —\nbut back he went to his house with aching heart\nand there at the palace found the brazen suitors\nskinning goats in the courtyard, singeing pigs for roasting.\nAntinous, smiling warmly, sauntered up to the prince,\ngrasped his hand and coaxed him, savoring his name:\n“Telemachus, my high and mighty, fierce young friend,\nno more nursing those violent words and actions now.\nCome, eat and drink with us, just like the old days.\n340  Whatever you want our people will provide. A ship\nand a picked crew to speed you to holy Pylos,\nout for the news about your noble father.”\nBut self-possessed Telemachus drew the line:\n“Antinous, now how could I dine with you in peace\nand take my pleasure? You ruffians carousing here!\nIsn’t it quite enough that you, my mother’s suitors,\nhave ravaged it all, my very best, these many years,\nwhile I was still a boy? But now that I’m full-grown\nand can hear the truth from others, absorb it too —\n350  now, yes, that the anger seethes inside me . . .\nI’ll stop at nothing to hurl destruction at your heads,\nwhether I go to Pylos or sit tight here at home.\nBut the trip I speak of will not end in failure.\nGo I will, as a passenger, nothing more,\nsince I don’t seem to command my own crew.\nThat, I’m sure, is the way that suits you best.”\nhe nonchalantly drew his hand from Antinous’ hand\nwhile the suitors, busy feasting in the halls,\nmocked and taunted him, flinging insults now.\n360  “God help us,” one young buck kept shouting,\n“he wants to slaughter us all!\nHe’s off to sandy Pylos to hire cutthroats,\neven Sparta perhaps, so hot to have our heads.\nWhy, he’d rove as far as Ephyra’s dark rich soil\nand run back home with lethal poison, slip it\ninto the bowl and wipe us out with drink!”\n“Who knows?” another young blade up and ventured.\n“Off in that hollow ship of his, he just might drown,\nfar from his friends, a drifter like his father.\n370  What a bore! He’d double our work for us,\nsplitting up his goods, parceling out his house\nto his mother and the man who weds the queen.”\nSo they scoffed\nbut Telemachus headed down to his father’s storeroom,\nbroad and vaulted, piled high with gold and bronze,\nchests packed with clothing, vats of redolent oil.\nAnd there, standing in close ranks against the wall,\nwere jars of seasoned, mellow wine, holding the drink\nunmixed inside them, fit for a god, waiting the day\nOdysseus, worn by hardship, might come home again.\n380  Doors, snugly fitted, doubly hung, were bolted shut\nand a housekeeper was in charge by night and day —\nher care, her vigilance, guarding all those treasures —\nEurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor’s son.\nTelemachus called her into the storeroom: “Come, nurse,\ndraw me off some wine in smaller traveling jars,\nmellow, the finest vintage you’ve been keeping,\nnext to what you reserve for our unlucky king —\nin case Odysseus might drop in from the blue\nand cheat the deadly spirits, make it home.\n390  Fill me an even dozen, seal them tightly.\nPour me barley in well-stitched leather bags,\ntwenty measures of meal, your stone-ground best.\nBut no one else must know. These rations now,\nput them all together. I’ll pick them up myself,\ntoward evening, just about the time that mother\nclimbs to her room and thinks of turning in.\nI’m sailing off to Sparta, sandy Pylos too,\nfor news of my dear father’s journey home.\nPerhaps I’ll catch some rumor.”\nA wail of grief —\n400  and his fond old nurse burst out in protest, sobbing:\n“Why, dear child, what craziness got into your head?\nWhy bent on rambling over the face of the earth? —\na darling only son! Your father’s worlds away,\ngod’s own Odysseus, dead in some strange land.\nAnd these brutes here, just wait, the moment you’re gone\nthey’ll all be scheming against you. Kill you by guile,\nthey will, and carve your birthright up in pieces.\nNo, sit tight here, guard your own things here.\nDon’t go roving over the barren salt sea —\nno need to suffer so!”\n410                        “Courage, old woman,”\nthoughtful Telemachus tried to reassure her,\n“there’s a god who made this plan.\nBut swear you won’t say anything to my mother.\nNot till ten or a dozen days have passed\nor she misses me herself and learns I’m gone.\nShe mustn’t mar her lovely face with tears.”\nThe old one swore a solemn oath to the gods\nand vowing she would never breathe a word,\nquickly drew off wine in two-eared jars\n420  and poured barley in well-stitched leather bags.\nTelemachus returned to the hall and joined the suitors.\nThen bright-eyed Pallas thought of one more step.\nDisguised as the prince, the goddess roamed through town,\npausing beside each likely crewman, giving orders:\n“Gather beside our ship at nightfall —be there.”\nShe asked Noëmon, Phronius’ generous son,\nto lend her a swift ship. He gladly volunteered.\nThe sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark.\nNow the goddess hauled the swift ship down to the water,\n430  stowed in her all the tackle well-rigged vessels carry,\nmoored her well away at the harbor’s very mouth\nand once the crew had gathered, rallying round,\nshe heartened every man.\nThen bright-eyed Pallas thought of one last thing.\nBack she went to King Odysseus’ halls and there\nshe showered sweet oblivion over the suitors,\ndazing them as they drank, knocking cups from hands.\nNo more loitering now, their eyes weighed down with sleep,\nthey rose and groped through town to find their beds.\n440  But calling the prince outside his timbered halls,\ntaking the build and voice of Mentor once again,\nflashing-eyed Athena urged him on: “Telemachus,\nyour comrades-at-arms are ready at the oars,\nwaiting for your command to launch. So come,\non with our voyage now, we’re wasting time.”\nAnd Pallas Athena sped away in the lead\nas he followed in her footsteps, man and goddess.\nOnce they reached the ship at the water’s edge\nthey found their long-haired shipmates on the beach.\n450  The prince, inspired, gave his first commands:\n“Come, friends, get the rations aboard!\nThey’re piled in the palace now.\nMy mother knows nothing of this. No servants either.\nOnly one has heard our plan.”\nHe led them back\nand the men fell in and fetched down all the stores\nand stowed them briskly, deep in the well-ribbed holds\nas Odysseus’ son directed. Telemachus climbed aboard.\nAthena led the way, assuming the pilot’s seat\nreserved astern, and he sat close beside her.\n460  Cables cast off, the crew swung to the oarlocks.\nBright-eyed Athena sent them a stiff following wind\nrippling out of the west, ruffling over the wine-dark sea\nas Telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates:\n“All lay hands to tackle!” They sprang to orders,\nhoisting the pinewood mast, they stepped it firm\nin its block amidships, lashed it fast with stays\nand with braided rawhide halyards hauled the white sail high.\nSuddenly wind hit full and the canvas bellied out\nand a dark blue wave, foaming up at the bow,\n470  sang out loud and strong as the ship made way,\nskimming the whitecaps, cutting toward her goal.\nAll running gear secure in the swift black craft,\nthey set up bowls and brimmed them high with wine\nand poured libations out to the everlasting gods\nwho never die —to Athena first of all,\nthe daughter of Zeus with flashing sea-gray eyes —\nand the ship went plunging all night long and through the dawn."

    "text": "As the sun sprang up, leaving the brilliant waters in its wake,\nclimbing the bronze sky to shower light on immortal gods\nand mortal men across the plowlands ripe with grain —\nthe ship pulled into Pylos, Neleus’ storied citadel,\nwhere the people lined the beaches,\nsacrificing sleek black bulls to Poseidon,\ngod of the sea-blue mane who shakes the earth.\nThey sat in nine divisions, each five hundred strong,\neach division offering up nine bulls, and while the people\n10  tasted the innards, burned the thighbones for the god,\nthe craft and crew came heading straight to shore.\nStriking sail, furling it in the balanced ship,\nthey moored her well and men swung down on land.\nTelemachus climbed out last, with Athena far in front\nand the bright-eyed goddess urged the prince along:\n“Telemachus, no more shyness, this is not the time!\nWe sailed the seas for this, for news of your father —\nwhere does he lie buried? what fate did he meet?\nSo go right up to Nestor, breaker of horses.\n20  We’ll make him yield the secrets of his heart.\nPress him yourself to tell the whole truth:\nhe’ll never lie —the man is far too wise.”\nThe prince replied, wise in his own way too,\n“How can I greet him, Mentor, even approach the king?\nI’m hardly adept at subtle conversation.\nSomeone my age might feel shy, what’s more,\ninterrogating an older man.”\n“Telemachus,”\nthe bright-eyed goddess Athena reassured him,\n“some of the words you’ll find within yourself,\n30  the rest some power will inspire you to say.\nYou least of all —I know —\nwere born and reared without the gods’ good will.”\nAnd Pallas Athena sped away in the lead\nas he followed in her footsteps —man and goddess\ngained the place where the Pylians met and massed.\nThere sat Nestor among his sons as friends around them\ndecked the banquet, roasted meats and skewered strips for broiling.\nAs soon as they saw the strangers, all came crowding down,\nwaving them on in welcome, urging them to sit.\nNestor’s son Pisistratus, first to reach them,\ngrasped their hands and sat them down at the feast\non fleecy throws spread out along the sandbanks,\nflanking his brother Thrasymedes and his father.\nHe gave them a share of innards, poured some wine\nin a golden cup and, lifting it warmly toward Athena,\ndaughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder,\ngreeted the goddess now with an invitation:\n“Say a prayer to lord Poseidon, stranger,\nhis is the feast you’ve found on your arrival.\n50  But once you’ve made your libation and your prayer —\nall according to ancient custom —hand this cup\nof hearty, seasoned wine to your comrade here\nso he can pour forth too. He too, I think,\nshould pray to the deathless ones himself.\nAll men need the gods . . .\nbut the man is younger, just about my age.\nThat’s why I give the gold cup first to you.”\nPisistratus placed in her hand the cup of mellow wine\nand Pallas rejoiced at the prince’s sense of tact\n60  in giving the golden winecup first to her.\nAt once she prayed intensely to Poseidon:\n“Hear me, Sea-lord, you who embrace the earth —\ndon’t deny our wishes, bring our prayers to pass!\nFirst, then, to Nestor and all his sons grant glory.\nThen to all these Pylians, for their splendid rites\ngrant a reward that warms their gracious hearts.\nAnd last, Poseidon, grant Telemachus and myself\nsafe passage home, the mission accomplished\nthat sped us here in our rapid black ship.”\n70    So she prayed, and brought it all to pass.\nShe offered the rich two-handled cup to Telemachus,\nOdysseus’ son, who echoed back her prayer word for word.\nThey roasted the prime cuts, pulled them off the spits\nand sharing out the portions, fell to the royal feast.\nOnce they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nold Nestor the noble charioteer began, at last:\n“Now’s the time, now they’ve enjoyed their meal,\nto probe our guests and find out who they are.\nStrangers —friends, who are you?\n80  Where did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes?\nOut on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates,\nsea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives\nto plunder other men?”\nPoised Telemachus answered,\nfilled with heart, the heart Athena herself inspired,\nto ask for the news about his father, gone so long,\nand make his name throughout the mortal world.\n“Nestor, son of Neleus, Achaea’s pride and glory —\nwhere are we from, you ask? I will tell you all.\nWe hail from Ithaca, under the heights of Nion.\n90  Our mission here is personal, nothing public now.\nI am on the trail of my father’s widespread fame,\nyou see, searching the earth to catch some news\nof great-hearted King Odysseus who, they say,\nfought with you to demolish Troy some years ago.\nAbout all the rest who fought the Trojans there,\nwe know where each one died his wretched death,\nbut father . . . even his death —\nthe son of Cronus shrouds it all in mystery.\nNo one can say for certain where he died,\n100  whether he went down on land at enemy hands\nor out on the open sea in Amphitrite’s breakers.\nThat’s why I’ve come to plead before you now,\nif you can tell me about his cruel death:\nperhaps you saw him die with your own eyes\nor heard the wanderer’s end from someone else.\nMore than all other men, that man was born for pain.\nDon’t soften a thing, from pity, respect for me —\ntell me, clearly, all your eyes have witnessed.\nI beg you —if ever my father, lord Odysseus,\n110  pledged you his word and made it good in action\nonce on the fields of Troy where you Achaeans suffered,\nremember his story now, tell me the truth.”\nNestor the noble charioteer replied at length:\n“Ah dear boy, since you call back such memories,\nsuch living hell we endured in distant Troy —\nwe headstrong fighting forces of Achaea —\nso many raids from shipboard down the foggy sea,\ncruising for plunder, wherever Achilles led the way;\nso many battles round King Priam’s walls we fought,\n120  so many gone, our best and bravest fell.\nThere Ajax lies, the great man of war.\nThere lies Achilles too.\nThere Patroclus, skilled as the gods in counsel.\nAnd there my own dear son, both strong and staunch,\nAntilochus —lightning on his feet and every inch a fighter!\nBut so many other things we suffered, past that count —\nwhat mortal in this wide world could tell it all?\nNot if you sat and probed his memory, five, six years,\ndelving for all the pains our brave Achaeans bore there.\n130  Your patience would fray, you’d soon head for home . . .\nNine years we wove a web of disaster for those Trojans,\npressing them hard with every tactic known to man,\nand only after we slaved did Zeus award us victory.\nAnd no one there could hope to rival Odysseus,\nnot for sheer cunning —\nat every twist of strategy he excelled us all.\nYour father, yes, if you are in fact his son . . .\nI look at you and a sense of wonder takes me.\nYour way with words —it’s just like his —I’d swear\n140  no youngster could ever speak like you, so apt, so telling.\nAs long as I and great Odysseus soldiered there,\nwhy, never once did we speak out at odds,\nneither in open muster nor in royal council:\nforever one in mind, in judgment balanced, shrewd,\nwe mapped our armies’ plans so things might turn out best.\nBut then, once we’d sacked King Priam’s craggy city,\nZeus contrived in his heart a fatal homeward run\nfor all the Achaeans who were fools, at least,\ndishonest too, so many met a disastrous end,\nthanks to the lethal rage\nof the mighty Father’s daughter. Eyes afire,\nAthena set them feuding, Atreus’ two sons . . .\nThey summoned all the Achaean ranks to muster,\nrashly, just at sunset —no hour to rally troops —\nand in they straggled, sodden with wine, our heroes.\nThe brothers harangued them, told them why they’d met:\na crisis —Menelaus urging the men to fix their minds\non the voyage home across the sea’s broad back,\nbut it brought no joy to Agamemnon, not at all.\n160  He meant to detain us there and offer victims,\nanything to appease Athena’s dreadful wrath —\npoor fool, he never dreamed Athena would not comply.\nThe minds of the everlasting gods don’t change so quickly.\nSo the two of them stood there, wrangling, back and forth\ntill the armies sprang up, their armor clashing, ungodly uproar —\nthe two plans split the ranks. That night we barely slept,\nseething with hard feelings against our own comrades,\nfor Zeus was brooding over us, poised to seal our doom . . .\nAt dawn, half of us hauled our vessels down to sea,\n170  we stowed our plunder, our sashed and lovely women.\nBut half the men held back, camped on the beach,\nwaiting it out for Agamemnon’s next commands\nwhile our contingent embarked —\nwe pushed off and sailed at a fast clip\nas a god smoothed out the huge troughing swells.\nWe reached Tenedos quickly, sacrificed to the gods,\nthe crews keen for home, but a quick return was not\nin Zeus’s plans, not yet: that cruel power\nloosed a cursed feud on us once again.\n180  Some swung their rolling warships hard about —\nOdysseus sailed them back, the flexible, wily king,\nveering over to Agamemnon now to shore his fortunes up.\nBut not I. Massing the ships that came in my flotilla,\nI sped away as the god’s mischief kept on brewing,\ndawning on me now. And Tydeus’ fighting son\nDiomedes fled too, rousing all his comrades.\nLate in the day the red-haired Menelaus joined us,\novertook us at Lesbos, debating the long route home:\nwhether to head north, over the top of rocky Chios,\nskirting Psyrie, keeping that island off to port\nor run south of Chios, by Mimas’ gusty cape.\nWe asked the god for a sign. He showed us one,\nhe urged us to cut out on the middle passage,\nstraight to Euboea now,\nescape a catastrophe, fast as we could sail!\nA shrilling wind came up, stiff, driving us on\nand on we raced, over the sea-lanes rife with fish\nand we made Geraestus Point in the dead of night.\nMany thighs of bulls we offered Poseidon there —\n200  thank god we’d crossed that endless reach of sea.\nThen on the fourth day out the crews of Diomedes,\nbreaker of horses, moored their balanced ships\nat Argos port, but I held course for Pylos, yes,\nand never once did the good strong wind go limp\nfrom the first day the god unleashed its blast.\nAnd so, dear boy, I made it home from Troy,\nin total ignorance, knowing nothing of their fates,\nthe ones who stayed behind:\nwho escaped with their lives and who went down.\n210  But still, all I’ve gathered by hearsay, sitting here\nin my own house —that you’ll learn, it’s only right,\nI’ll hide nothing now.\nThey say the Myrmidons,\nthose savage spearmen led by the shining son\nof lionhearted Achilles, traveled home unharmed.\nPhiloctetes the gallant son of Poias, safe as well.\nIdomeneus brought his whole contingent back to Crete,\nall who’d escaped the war —the sea snatched none from him.\nBut Atreus’ son Agamemnon . . . you yourselves, even\nin far-off Ithaca, must have heard how he returned,\n220  how Aegisthus hatched the king’s horrendous death.\nBut what a price he paid, in blood, in suffering.\nAh how fine it is, when a man is brought down,\nto leave a son behind! Orestes took revenge,\nhe killed that cunning, murderous Aegisthus,\nwho’d killed his famous father.\nAnd you, my friend —\nhow tall and handsome I see you now —be brave, you too,\nso men to come will sing your praises down the years.”\nTelemachus, weighing the challenge closely, answered,\n“Oh Nestor, son of Neleus, Achaea’s pride and glory,\n230  what a stroke of revenge that was! All Achaeans\nwill spread Orestes’ fame across the world,\na song for those to come.\nIf only the gods would arm me in such power\nI’d take revenge on the lawless, brazen suitors\nriding roughshod over me, plotting reckless outrage.\nBut for me the gods have spun out no such joy,\nfor my father or myself. I must bear up,\nthat’s all.”\nAnd the old charioteer replied,\n“Now that you mention it, dear boy, I do recall\n240  a mob of suitors, they say, besets your mother\nthere in your own house, against your will,\nand plots your ruin. Tell me, though, do you\nlet yourself be so abused, or do people round about,\nstirred up by the prompting of some god, despise you now?\nWho knows if he will return someday to take revenge\non all their violence? Single-handed perhaps\nor with an Argive army at his back? If only\nthe bright-eyed goddess chose to love you just\nas she lavished care on brave Odysseus, years ago\n250  in the land of Troy where we Achaeans struggled!\nI’ve never seen the immortals show so much affection\nas Pallas openly showed him, standing by your father —\nif only she’d favor you, tend you with all her heart,\nmany a suitor then would lose all thought of marriage,\nblotted out forever.”\n“Never, your majesty,”\nTelemachus countered gravely, “that will never\ncome to pass, I know. What you say dumbfounds me,\nstaggers imagination! Hope, hope as I will,\nthat day will never dawn . . .\nnot even if the gods should will it so.”\n260                                         “Telemachus!”\nPallas Athena broke in sharply, her eyes afire —\n“What’s this nonsense slipping through your teeth?\nIt’s light work for a willing god to save a mortal\neven half the world away. Myself, I’d rather\nsail through years of trouble and labor home\nand see that blessed day, than hurry home\nto die at my own hearth like Agamemnon,\nkilled by Aegisthus’ cunning —by his own wife.\nBut the great leveler, Death: not even the gods\n270  can defend a man, not even one they love, that day\nwhen fate takes hold and lays him out at last.”\nwise Telemachus said, “distraught as we are for him,\nlet’s speak of this no more. My father’s return?\nIt’s inconceivable now. Long ago the undying gods\nhave sealed his death, his black doom. But now\nthere’s another question I would put to Nestor:\nNestor excels all men for sense and justice,\nhis knowledge of the world.\nThree generations he has ruled, they say,\n280  and to my young eyes he seems a deathless god!\nNestor, son of Neleus, tell me the whole story —\nhow did the great king Agamemnon meet his death?\nWhere was Menelaus? What fatal trap did he set,\nthat treacherous Aegisthus, to bring down a man\nfar stronger than himself? Was Menelaus gone\nfrom Achaean Argos, roving the world somewhere,\nso the coward found the nerve to kill the king?”\nAnd old Nestor the noble charioteer replied:\n“Gladly, my boy, I’ll tell you the story first to last . . .\n290  Right you are, you guess what would have happened\nif red-haired Menelaus, arriving back from Troy,\nhad found Aegisthus alive in Agamemnon’s palace.\nNo barrow piled high on the earth for his dead body,\nno, the dogs and birds would have feasted on his corpse,\nsprawled on the plain outside the city gates, and no one,\nno woman in all Achaea, would have wept a moment,\nsuch a monstrous crime the man contrived!\nBut there we were, camped at Troy, battling out\nthe long hard campaign while he at his ease at home,\n300  in the depths of Argos, stallion-country —he lay siege\nto the wife of Agamemnon, luring, enticing her with talk.\nAt first, true, she spurned the idea of such an outrage,\nClytemnestra the queen, her will was faithful still.\nAnd there was a man, what’s more, a bard close by,\nto whom Agamemnon, setting sail for Troy,\ngave strict commands to guard his wife. But then,\nthat day the doom of the gods had bound her to surrender,\nAegisthus shipped the bard away to a desert island,\nmarooned him there, sweet prize for the birds of prey,\n310  and swept her off to his own house, lover lusting for lover.\nAnd many thighbones he burned on the gods’ holy altars,\nmany gifts he hung on the temple walls —gold, brocades —\nin thanks for a conquest past his maddest hopes.\nyou see, were sailing home from Troy in the same squadron,\nMenelaus and I, comrades-in-arms from years of war.\nBut as we rounded holy Sounion, Athens’ headland,\nlord Apollo attacked Atrides’ helmsman, aye,\nwith his gentle shafts he shot the man to death —\nan iron grip on the tiller, the craft scudding fast —\nPhrontis, Onetor’s son, who excelled all men alive\nat steering ships when gales bore down in fury.\nSo Menelaus, straining to sail on, was held back\ntill he could bury his mate with fitting rites.\nBut once he’d got off too, plowing the wine-dark sea\nin his ribbed ships, and made a run to Malea’s beetling cape,\nfarseeing Zeus decided to give the man rough sailing,\npoured a hurricane down upon him, shrilling winds,\ngiant, rearing whitecaps, monstrous, mountains high.\nThere at a stroke he cut the fleet in half and drove\none wing to Crete, where Cydonians make their homes\nalong the Iardanus River. Now, there’s a sheer cliff\nplunging steep to the surf at the farthest edge of Gortyn,\nout on the mist-bound sea, where the South Wind piles breakers,\nhuge breakers, left of the headland’s horn, toward Phaestos,\nwith only a low reef to block the crushing tides.\nIn they sailed, and barely escaped their death —\nthe ships’ crews, that is —\nthe rollers smashed their hulls against the rocks.\nBut as for the other five with pitch-black prows,\nthe wind and current swept them on toward Egypt.\nSo Menelaus, amassing a hoard of stores and gold,\nwas off cruising his ships to foreign ports of call\nwhile Aegisthus hatched his vicious work at home.\nSeven years he lorded over Mycenae rich in gold,\nonce he’d killed Agamemnon —he ground the people down.\nBut the eighth year ushered in his ruin, Prince Orestes\nhome from Athens, yes, he cut him down, that cunning,\nmurderous Aegisthus, who’d killed his famous father.\nVengeance done, he held a feast for the Argives,\n350  to bury his hated mother, craven Aegisthus too,\nthe very day Menelaus arrived, lord of the warcry,\nfreighted with all the wealth his ships could carry.\ndear boy, take care. Don’t rove from home too long,\ntoo far, leaving your own holdings unprotected —\ncrowds in your palace so brazen\nthey’ll carve up all your wealth, devour it all,\nand then your journey here will come to nothing.\nStill I advise you, urge you to visit Menelaus.\nHe’s back from abroad at last, from people so removed\n360  you might abandon hope of ever returning home,\nonce the winds had driven you that far off course,\ninto a sea so vast not even cranes could wing their way\nin one year’s flight —so vast it is, so awesome . . .\nSo, off you go with your ships and shipmates now.\nOr if you’d rather go by land, there’s team and chariot,\nmy sons at your service too, and they’ll escort you\nto sunny Lacedaemon, home of the red-haired king.\nPress him yourself to tell the whole truth:\nhe’ll never lie —the man is far too wise.”\nSo he closed\n370  as the sun set and darkness swept across the earth\nand the bright-eyed goddess Pallas spoke for all:\n“There was a tale, old soldier, so well told.\nCome, cut out the victims’ tongues and mix the wine,\nso once we’ve poured libations out to the Sea-lord\nand every other god, we’ll think of sleep. High time —\nthe light’s already sunk in the western shadows.\nIt’s wrong to linger long at the gods’ feast;\nwe must be on our way.”\nZeus’s daughter —\nthey all hung closely on every word she said.\n380  Heralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing,\nthe young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine,\nthey tipped first drops for the god in every cup\nthen poured full rounds for all. They rose and flung\nthe victims’ tongues on the fire and poured libations out.\nWhen they’d poured, and drunk to their hearts’ content,\nAthena and Prince Telemachus both started up\nto head for their ship at once.\nBut Nestor held them there, objecting strongly:\n“Zeus forbid —and the other deathless gods as well —\n390  that you resort to your ship and put my house behind\nlike a rank pauper’s without a stitch of clothing,\nno piles of rugs, no blankets in his place\nfor host and guests to slumber soft in comfort.\nWhy, I’ve plenty of fine rugs and blankets here.\nNo, by god, the true son of my good friend Odysseus\nwon’t bed down on a ship’s deck, not while I’m alive\nor my sons are left at home to host our guests,\nwhoever comes to our palace, newfound friends.”\n“Dear old man,\nyou’re right,” Athena exclaimed, her eyes brightening now.\n400  “Telemachus should oblige you. Much the better way.\nLet him follow you now, sleep in your halls,\nbut I’ll go back to our trim black ship,\nhearten the crew and give each man his orders.\nI’m the only veteran in their ranks, I tell you.\nAll the rest, of an age with brave Telemachus,\nare younger men who sailed with him as friends.\nI’ll bed down there by the dark hull tonight,\nat dawn push off for the proud Cauconians.\nThose people owe me a debt long overdue,\n410  and no mean sum, believe me.\nBut you, seeing my friend is now your guest,\nspeed him on his way with a chariot and your son\nand give him the finest horses that you have,\nbred for stamina, trained to race the wind.”\nWith that the bright-eyed goddess winged away\nin an eagle’s form and flight.\nAmazement fell on all the Achaeans there.\nThe old king, astonished by what he’d seen,\ngrasped Telemachus’ hand and cried out to the prince,\n420  “Dear boy —never fear you’ll be a coward or defenseless,\nnot if at your young age the gods will guard you so.\nOf all who dwell on Olympus, this was none but she,\nZeus’s daughter, the glorious one, his third born,\nwho prized your gallant father among the Argives.\nNow, O Queen, be gracious! Give us high renown,\nmyself, my children, my loyal wife and queen.\nAnd I will make you a sacrifice, a yearling heifer\nbroad in the brow, unbroken, never yoked by men.\nI’ll offer it up to you —I’ll sheathe its horns in gold.”\n430    So he prayed, and Pallas Athena heard his prayer.\nAnd Nestor the noble chariot-driver led them on,\nhis sons and sons-in-law, back to his regal palace.\nOnce they reached the storied halls of the aged king\nthey sat on rows of low and high-backed chairs.\nAs they arrived the old man mixed them all a bowl,\nstirring the hearty wine, seasoned eleven years\nbefore a servant broached it, loosed its seal.\nMulling it in the bowl, old Nestor poured\na libation out, praying hard to Pallas Athena,\n440  daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder.\nOnce they had poured their offerings, drunk their fill,\nthe Pylians went to rest, each in his own house.\nBut the noble chariot-driver let Telemachus,\nKing Odysseus’ son, sleep at the palace now,\non a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade,\nwith Prince Pisistratus close beside him there,\nthe young spearman, already captain of armies,\nthough the last son still unwed within the halls.\nThe king retired to chambers deep in his lofty house\n450  where the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nold Nestor the noble chariot-driver climbed from bed,\nwent out and took his seat on the polished stones,\na bench glistening white, rubbed with glossy oil,\nplaced for the king before his looming doors.\nThere Neleus held his sessions years ago,\na match for the gods in counsel,\nbut his fate had long since forced him down to Death.\nNow royal Nestor in turn, Achaea’s watch and ward,\n460  sat there holding the scepter while his sons,\ncoming out of their chambers, clustered round him,\nhovering near: Echephron, Stratius, Perseus\nand Aretus, Thrasymedes like a god, and sixth,\nyoung lord Pisistratus came to join their ranks.\nThey escorted Prince Telemachus in to sit beside them.\nNestor, noble charioteer, began the celebration:\n“Quickly, my children, carry out my wishes now\nso I may please the gods, Athena first of all —\nshe came to me at Poseidon’s flowing feast,\n470  Athena in all her glory!\nNow someone go to the fields to fetch a heifer,\nlead her here at once —a herdsman drive her in.\nSomeone hurry down to Prince Telemachus’ black ship\nand bring up all his crewmen, leave just two behind.\nAnd another tell our goldsmith, skilled Laerces,\nto come and sheathe the heifer’s horns in gold.\nThe rest stay here together. Tell the maids\ninside the hall to prepare a sumptuous feast —\nbring seats and firewood, bring pure water too.”\n480    They all pitched in to carry out his orders.\nThe heifer came from the fields, the crewmen came\nfrom brave Telemachus’ ship, and the smith came in\nwith all his gear in hand, the tools of his trade,\nthe anvil, hammer and well-wrought tongs he used\nfor working gold. And Athena came as well\nto attend her sacred rites.\nThe old horseman passed the gold to the smith,\nand twining the foil, he sheathed the heifer’s horns\nso the goddess’ eyes might dazzle, delighted with the gift.\n490  Next Stratius and Echephron led the beast by the horns.\nAretus, coming up from the storeroom, brought them\nlustral water filling a flower-braided bowl,\nin his other hand, the barley in a basket.\nThrasymedes, staunch in combat, stood ready,\nwhetted ax in his grasp to cut the heifer down,\nand Perseus held the basin for the blood.\nNow Nestor the old charioteer began the rite.\nPouring the lustral water, scattering barley-meal,\nhe lifted up his ardent prayers to Pallas Athena,\n500  launching the sacrifice, flinging onto the fire\nthe first tufts of hair from the victim’s head.\nPrayers said, the scattering barley strewn,\nsuddenly Nestor’s son impetuous Thrasymedes\nstrode up close and struck —the ax chopped\nthe neck tendons through —\nand the blow stunned\nthe heifer’s strength —\nThe women shrilled their cry,\nNestor’s daughters, sons’ wives and his own loyal wife\nEurydice, Clymenus’ eldest daughter. Then, hoisting up\nthe victim’s head from the trampled earth, they held her fast\n510  as the captain of men Pisistratus slashed her throat.\nDark blood gushed forth, life ebbed from her limbs —\nthey quartered her quickly, cut the thighbones out\nand all according to custom wrapped them round in fat,\na double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh.\nAnd the old king burned these over dried split wood\nand over the fire poured out glistening wine\nwhile young men at his side held five-pronged forks.\nOnce they’d burned the bones and tasted the organs,\nthey sliced the rest into pieces, spitted them on skewers\n520  and raising points to the fire, broiled all the meats.\nDuring the ritual lovely Polycaste, youngest daughter\nof Nestor, Neleus’ son, had bathed Telemachus.\nRinsing him off now, rubbing him down with oil,\nshe drew a shirt and handsome cape around him.\nOut of his bath he stepped, glistening like a god,\nstrode in and sat by the old commander Nestor.\nThey roasted the prime cuts, pulled them off the spits\nand sat down to the feast while ready stewards saw\nto rounds of wine and kept the gold cups flowing.\n530  When they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nNestor the noble chariot-driver issued orders:\n“Hurry, my boys! Bring Telemachus horses,\na good full-maned team —\nhitch them to a chariot —he must be off at once.”\nThey listened closely, snapped to his commands\nand hitched a rapid team to a chariot’s yoke in haste.\nA housekeeper stowed some bread and wine aboard\nand meats too, food fit for the sons of kings.\nTelemachus vaulted onto the splendid chariot —\n540  right beside him Nestor’s son Pisistratus,\ncaptain of armies, boarded, seized the reins,\nwhipped the team to a run and on the horses flew,\nholding nothing back, out into open country,\nleaving the heights of Pylos fading in their trail,\nshaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long.\nThe sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark\nas they reached Phera, pulling up to Diocles’ halls,\nthe son of Ortilochus, son of the Alpheus River.\nHe gave them a royal welcome; there they slept the night.\n550    When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthey yoked their pair again, mounted the blazoned car\nand out through the gates and echoing colonnade\nthey whipped the team to a run and on they flew,\nholding nothing back —and the princes reached\nthe wheatlands, straining now for journey’s end,\nso fast those purebred stallions raced them on\nas the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark."

    "text": "At last they gained the ravines of Lacedaemon ringed by hills\nand drove up to the halls of Menelaus in his glory.\nThey found the king inside his palace, celebrating\nwith throngs of kinsmen a double wedding-feast\nfor his son and lovely daughter. The princess\nhe was sending on to the son of great Achilles,\nbreaker of armies. Years ago Menelaus vowed,\nhe nodded assent at Troy and pledged her hand\nand now the gods were sealing firm the marriage.\n10  So he was sending her on her way with team and chariot,\nnorth to the Myrmidons’ famous city governed by her groom.\nFrom Sparta he brought Alector’s daughter as the bride\nfor his own full-grown son, the hardy Megapenthes,\nborn to him by a slave. To Helen the gods had granted\nno more offspring once she had borne her first child,\nthe breathtaking Hermione,\na luminous beauty gold as Aphrodite.\nthey feasted within the grand, high-roofed palace,\nall the kin and clansmen of Menelaus in his glory,\n20  reveling warmly here as in their midst\nan inspired bard sang out and struck his lyre —\nand through them a pair of tumblers dashed and sprang,\nwhirling in leaping handsprings, leading on the dance.\nThe travelers, Nestor’s shining son and Prince Telemachus,\nhad brought themselves and their horses to a standstill\njust outside the court when good lord Eteoneus,\npassing through the gates now, saw them there,\nand the ready aide-in-arms of Menelaus\ntook the message through his sovereign’s halls\n30  and stepping close to his master broke the news:\n“Strangers have just arrived, your majesty, Menelaus.\nTwo men, but they look like kin of mighty Zeus himself.\nTell me, should we unhitch their team for them\nor send them to someone free to host them well?”\nThe red-haired king took great offense at that:\n“Never a fool before, Eteoneus, son of Boëthous,\nnow I see you’re babbling like a child!\nJust think of all the hospitality we enjoyed\nat the hands of other men before we made it home,\n40  and god save us from such hard treks in years to come.\nQuick, unhitch their team. And bring them in,\nstrangers, guests, to share our flowing feast.”\nBack through the halls he hurried, calling out\nto other brisk attendants to follow quickly.\nThey loosed the sweating team from under the yoke,\ntethered them fast by reins inside the horse-stalls,\ntossing feed at their hoofs, white barley mixed with wheat,\nand canted the chariot up against the polished walls,\nshimmering in the sun, then ushered in their guests,\n50  into that magnificent place. Both struck by the sight,\nthey marveled up and down the house of the warlord dear to Zeus —\na radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came flooding\nthrough the high-roofed halls of illustrious Menelaus.\nOnce they’d feasted their eyes with gazing at it all,\ninto the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed.\nWhen women had washed them, rubbed them down with oil\nand drawn warm fleece and shirts around their shoulders,\nthey took up seats of honor next to Atrides Menelaus.\nA maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher\n60  and over a silver basin tipped it out\nso they might rinse their hands,\nthen pulled a gleaming table to their side.\nA staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them,\nappetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.\nAs a carver lifted platters of meat toward them,\nmeats of every sort, and set before them golden cups,\nthe red-haired king Menelaus greeted both guests warmly:\n“Help yourselves to food, and welcome! Once you’ve dined\nwe’ll ask you who you are. But your parents’ blood\n70  is hardly lost in you. You must be born of kings,\nbred by the gods to wield the royal scepter.\nNo mean men could sire sons like you.”\nWith those words\nhe passed them a fat rich loin with his own hands,\nthe choicest part, that he’d been served himself.\nThey reached for the good things that lay outspread\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nTelemachus, leaning his head close to Nestor’s son,\nspoke low to the prince so no one else could hear:\n“Look, Pisistratus —joy of my heart, my friend —\n80  the sheen of bronze, the blaze of gold and amber,\nsilver, ivory too, through all this echoing mansion!\nSurely Zeus’s court on Olympus must be just like this,\nthe boundless glory of all this wealth inside!\nMy eyes dazzle . . . I am struck with wonder.”\nBut the red-haired warlord overheard his guest\nand cut in quickly with winged words for both:\n“No man alive could rival Zeus, dear boys,\nwith his everlasting palace and possessions.\nBut among men, I must say, few if any\n90  could rival me in riches. Believe me,\nmuch I suffered, many a mile I roved to haul\nsuch treasures home in my ships. Eight years out,\nwandering off as far as Cyprus, Phoenicia, even Egypt,\nI reached the Ethiopians, Sidonians, Erembians —Libya too,\nwhere lambs no sooner spring from the womb than they grow horns.\nThree times in the circling year the ewes give birth.\nSo no one, neither king nor shepherd could want\nfor cheese or mutton, or sweet milk either,\nudders swell for the sucklings round the year.\n100    But while I roamed those lands, amassing a fortune,\na stranger killed my brother, blind to the danger, duped blind —\nthanks to the cunning of his cursed, murderous queen!\nSo I rule all this wealth with no great joy.\nYou must have heard my story from your fathers,\nwhoever they are —what hardships I endured,\nhow I lost this handsome palace built for the ages,\nfilled to its depths with hoards of gorgeous things.\nWell, would to god I’d stayed right here in my own house\nwith a third of all that wealth and they were still alive,\n110  all who died on the wide plain of Troy those years ago,\nfar from the stallion-land of Argos.\nmuch as I weep for all my men, grieving sorely,\ntime and again, sitting here in the royal halls,\nnow indulging myself in tears, now brushing tears away —\nthe grief that numbs the spirit gluts us quickly —\nfor none of all those comrades, pained as I am,\ndo I grieve as much for one . . .\nthat man who makes sleep hateful, even food,\nas I pore over his memory. No one, no Achaean\n120  labored hard as Odysseus labored or achieved so much.\nAnd how did his struggles end? In suffering for that man;\nfor me, in relentless, heartbreaking grief for him,\nlost and gone so long now —dead or alive, who knows?\nHow they must mourn him too, Laertes, the old man,\nand self-possessed Penelope. Telemachus as well,\nthe boy he left a babe in arms at home.”\nSuch memories\nstirred in the young prince a deep desire to grieve\nfor Odysseus. Tears streamed down his cheeks\nand wet the ground when he heard his father’s name,\n130  both hands clutching his purple robe before his eyes.\nMenelaus recognized him at once but pondered\nwhether to let him state his father’s name\nor probe him first and prompt him step by step.\nWhile he debated all this now within himself,\nHelen emerged from her scented, lofty chamber —\nstriking as Artemis with her golden shafts —\nand a train of women followed . . .\nAdreste drew up her carved reclining-chair,\nAlcippe brought a carpet of soft-piled fleece,\nPhylo carried her silver basket given by Alcandre,\nKing Polybus’ wife, who made his home in Egyptian Thebes\nwhere the houses overflow with the greatest troves of treasure.\nThe king gave Menelaus a pair of bathing-tubs in silver,\ntwo tripods, ten bars of gold, and apart from these\nhis wife presented Helen her own precious gifts:\na golden spindle, a basket that ran on casters,\nsolid silver polished off with rims of gold.\nNow Phylo her servant rolled it in beside her,\nheaped to the brim with yarn prepared for weaving;\n150  the spindle swathed in violet wool lay tipped across it.\nHelen leaned back in her chair, a stool beneath her feet,\nand pressed her husband at once for each detail:\n“Do we know, my lord Menelaus, who our visitors\nclaim to be, our welcome new arrivals?\nRight or wrong, what can I say? My heart tells me\nto come right out and say I’ve never seen such a likeness,\nneither in man nor woman —I’m amazed at the sight.\nTo the life he’s like the son of great Odysseus,\nsurely he’s Telemachus! The boy that hero left\n160  a babe in arms at home when all you Achaeans\nfought at Troy, launching your headlong battles\njust for my sake, shameless whore that I was.”\n“My dear, my dear,” the red-haired king assured her,\n“now that you mention it, I see the likeness too . . .\nOdysseus’ feet were like the boy’s, his hands as well,\nhis glancing eyes, his head, and the fine shock of hair.\nYes, and just now, as I was talking about Odysseus,\nremembering how he struggled, suffered, all for me,\na flood of tears came streaming down his face\n170  and he clutched his purple robe before his eyes.”\n“Right you are” —Pisistratus stepped in quickly —\n“son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies:\nhere is the son of that great hero, as you say.\nBut the man is modest, he would be ashamed\nto make a show of himself, his first time here,\nand interrupt you. We delight in your voice\nas if some god were speaking!\nThe noble horseman Nestor sent me along\nto be his escort. Telemachus yearned to see you,\n180  so you could give him some advice or urge some action.\nWhen a father’s gone, his son takes much abuse\nin a house where no one comes to his defense.\nSo with Telemachus now. His father’s gone.\nNo men at home will shield him from the worst.”\n“Wonderful!” the red-haired king cried out.\n“The son of my dearest friend, here in my own house!\nThat man who performed a hundred feats of arms for me.\nAnd I swore that when he came I’d give him a hero’s welcome,\nhim above all my comrades —if only Olympian Zeus,\n190  farseeing Zeus, had granted us both safe passage\nhome across the sea in our swift trim ships.\nWhy, I’d have settled a city in Argos for him,\nbuilt him a palace, shipped him over from Ithaca,\nhim and all his wealth, his son, his people too —\nemptied one of the cities nestling round about us,\none I rule myself. Both fellow-countrymen then,\nhow often we’d have mingled side-by-side!\nNothing could have parted us,\nbound by love for each other, mutual delight . . .\n200  till death’s dark cloud came shrouding round us both.\nBut god himself, jealous of all this, no doubt,\nrobbed that unlucky man, him and him alone,\nof the day of his return.”\nSo Menelaus mused\nand stirred in them all a deep desire to grieve.\nHelen of Argos, daughter of Zeus, dissolved in tears,\nTelemachus wept too, and so did Atreus’ son Menelaus.\nNor could Nestor’s son Pisistratus stay dry-eyed,\nremembering now his gallant brother Antilochus,\ncut down by Memnon, splendid son of the Morning.\n210  Thinking of him, the young prince broke out:\n“Old Nestor always spoke of you, son of Atreus,\nas the wisest man of all the men he knew,\nwhenever we talked about you there at home,\nquestioning back and forth. So now, please,\nif it isn’t out of place, indulge me, won’t you?\nMyself, I take no joy in weeping over supper.\nMorning will soon bring time enough for that.\nNot that I’d grudge a tear\nfor any man gone down to meet his fate.\n220  What other tribute can we pay to wretched men\nthan to cut a lock, let tears roll down our cheeks?\nAnd I have a brother of my own among the dead,\nand hardly the poorest soldier in our ranks.\nYou probably knew him. I never met him, never\nsaw him myself. But they say he outdid our best,\nAntilochus —lightning on his feet and every inch a fighter!”\n“Well said, my friend,” the red-haired king replied.\n“Not even an older man could speak and do as well.\nYour father’s son you are —your words have all his wisdom.\n230  It’s easy to spot the breed of a man whom Zeus\nhas marked for joy in birth and marriage both.\nTake great King Nestor now:\nZeus has blessed him, all his livelong days,\ngrowing rich and sleek in his old age at home,\nhis sons expert with spears and full of sense.\nWell, so much for the tears that caught us just now;\nlet’s think again of supper. Come, rinse our hands.\nTomorrow, at dawn, will offer me and Telemachus\ntime to talk and trade our thoughts in full.”\nAsphalion quickly rinsed their hands with water,\nanother of King Menelaus’ ready aides-in-arms.\nAgain they reached for the good things set before them.\nThen Zeus’s daughter Helen thought of something else.\nInto the mixing-bowl from which they drank their wine\nshe slipped a drug, heart’s-ease, dissolving anger,\nmagic to make us all forget our pains . . .\nNo one who drank it deeply, mulled in wine,\ncould let a tear roll down his cheeks that day,\nnot even if his mother should die, his father die,\n250  not even if right before his eyes some enemy brought down\na brother or darling son with a sharp bronze blade.\nSo cunning the drugs that Zeus’s daughter plied,\npotent gifts from Polydamna the wife of Thon,\na woman of Egypt, land where the teeming soil\nbears the richest yield of herbs in all the world:\nmany health itself when mixed in the wine,\nand many deadly poison.\nEvery man is a healer there, more skilled\nthan any other men on earth —Egyptians born\n260  of the healing god himself. So now Helen, once\nshe had drugged the wine and ordered winecups filled,\nresuming the conversation, entertained the group:\n“My royal king Menelaus —welcome guests here,\nsons of the great as well! Zeus can present us\ntimes of joy and times of grief in turn:\nall lies within his power.\nSo come, let’s sit back in the palace now,\ndine and warm our hearts with the old stories.\nI will tell something perfect for the occasion.\n270  Surely I can’t describe or even list them all,\nthe exploits crowding fearless Odysseus’ record,\nbut what a feat that hero dared and carried off\nin the land of Troy where you Achaeans suffered!\nScarring his own body with mortifying strokes,\nthrowing filthy rags on his back like any slave,\nhe slipped into the enemy’s city, roamed its streets —\nall disguised, a totally different man, a beggar,\nhardly the figure he cut among Achaea’s ships.\nThat’s how Odysseus infiltrated Troy,\n280  and no one knew him at all . . .\nI alone, I spotted him for the man he was,\nkept questioning him —the crafty one kept dodging.\nBut after I’d bathed him, rubbed him down with oil,\ngiven him clothes to wear and sworn a binding oath\nnot to reveal him as Odysseus to the Trojans, not\ntill he was back at his swift ships and shelters,\nthen at last he revealed to me, step by step,\nthe whole Achaean strategy. And once he’d cut\na troop of Trojans down with his long bronze sword,\n290  back he went to his comrades, filled with information.\nThe rest of the Trojan women shrilled their grief. Not I:\nmy heart leapt up —\nmy heart had changed by now —\nto sail back home again! I grieved too late for the madness\nAphrodite sent me, luring me there, far from my dear land,\nforsaking my own child, my bridal bed, my husband too,\na man who lacked for neither brains nor beauty.”\nAnd the red-haired Menelaus answered Helen:\n“There was a tale, my lady. So well told.\nNow then, I have studied, in my time,\n300  the plans and minds of great ones by the score.\nAnd I have traveled over a good part of the world\nbut never once have I laid eyes on a man like him —\nwhat a heart that fearless Odysseus had inside him!\nWhat a piece of work the hero dared and carried off\nin the wooden horse where all our best encamped,\nour champions armed with bloody death for Troy . . .\nwhen along you came, Helen —roused, no doubt,\nby a dark power bent on giving Troy some glory,\nand dashing Prince Deiphobus squired your every step.\n310  Three times you sauntered round our hollow ambush,\nfeeling, stroking its flanks,\nchallenging all our fighters, calling each by name —\nyours was the voice of all our long-lost wives!\nAnd Diomedes and I, crouched tight in the midst\nwith great Odysseus, hearing you singing out,\nwere both keen to spring up and sally forth\nor give you a sudden answer from inside,\nbut Odysseus damped our ardor, reined us back.\nThen all the rest of the troops kept stock-still,\nall but Anticlus. He was hot to salute you now\nbut Odysseus clamped his great hands on the man’s mouth\nand shut it, brutally —yes, he saved us all,\nholding on grim-set till Pallas Athena\nlured you off at last.”\nBut clear-sighted Telemachus ventured,\n“Son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies,\nso much the worse, for not one bit of that\nsaved him from grisly death . . .\nnot even a heart of iron could have helped.\n330  But come, send us off to bed. It’s time to rest,\ntime to enjoy the sweet relief of sleep.”\nAnd Helen briskly told her serving-women\nto make beds in the porch’s shelter, lay down\nsome heavy purple throws for the beds themselves,\nand over them spread some blankets, thick woolly robes,\na warm covering laid on top. Torches in hand,\nthey left the hall and made up beds at once.\nThe herald led the two guests on and so they slept\noutside the palace under the forecourt’s colonnade,\n340  young Prince Telemachus and Nestor’s shining son.\nMenelaus retired to chambers deep in his lofty house\nwith Helen the pearl of women loosely gowned beside him.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthe lord of the warcry climbed from bed and dressed,\nover his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword,\nfastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet,\nstepped from his bedroom, handsome as a god,\nand sat beside Telemachus, asking, kindly,\n“Now, my young prince, tell me what brings you here\n350  to sunny Lacedaemon, sailing over the sea’s broad back.\nA public matter or private? Tell me the truth now.”\nAnd with all the poise he had, Telemachus replied,\n“Son of Atreus, King Menelaus, captain of armies,\nI came in the hope that you can tell me now\nsome news about my father.\nMy house is being devoured, my rich farms destroyed,\nmy palace crammed with enemies, slaughtering on and on\nmy droves of sheep and shambling longhorn cattle.\nSuitors plague my mother —the insolent, overweening . . .\n360  That’s why I’ve come to plead before you now,\nif you can tell me about his cruel death:\nperhaps you saw him die with your own eyes\nor heard the wanderer’s end from someone else.\nMore than all other men, that man was born for pain.\nDon’t soften a thing, from pity, respect for me —\ntell me, clearly, all your eyes have witnessed.\nI beg you —if ever my father, lord Odysseus,\npledged you his word and made it good in action\nonce on the fields of Troy where you Achaeans suffered,\nremember his story now, tell me the truth.”\n370                                               “How shameful!”\nthe red-haired king burst out in anger. “That’s the bed\nof a brave man of war they’d like to crawl inside,\nthose spineless, craven cowards!\nWeak as the doe that beds down her fawns\nin a mighty lion’s den —her newborn sucklings —\nthen trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends\nto graze her fill, but back the lion comes to his own lair\nand the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death,\njust what Odysseus will deal that mob —ghastly death.\n380  Ah if only —Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo —\nthat man who years ago in the games at Lesbos\nrose to Philomelides’ challenge, wrestled him,\npinned him down with one tremendous throw\nand the Argives roared with joy . . .\nif only that Odysseus sported with those suitors,\na blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot!\nBut about the things you’ve asked me, so intently,\nI’ll skew and sidestep nothing, not deceive you, ever.\nOf all he told me —the Old Man of the Sea who never lies —\n390  I’ll hide or hold back nothing, not a single word.\nIt was in Egypt, where the gods still marooned me,\neager as I was to voyage home . . . I’d failed,\nyou see, to render them full, flawless victims,\nand gods are always keen to see their rules obeyed.\nNow, there’s an island out in the ocean’s heavy surge,\nwell off the Egyptian coast —they call it Pharos —\nfar as a deep-sea ship can go in one day’s sail\nwith a whistling wind astern to drive her on.\nThere’s a snug harbor there, good landing beach\n400  where crews pull in, draw water up from the dark wells\nthen push their vessels off for passage out.\nBut here the gods becalmed me twenty days . . .\nnot a breath of the breezes ruffling out to sea\nthat speed a ship across the ocean’s broad back.\nNow our rations would all have been consumed,\nour crews’ stamina too, if one of the gods\nhad not felt sorry for me, shown me mercy,\nEidothea, a daughter of Proteus,\nthat great power, the Old Man of the Sea.\n410  My troubles must have moved her to the heart\nwhen she met me trudging by myself without my men.\nThey kept roaming around the beach, day in, day out,\nfishing with twisted hooks, their bellies racked by hunger.\nWell, she came right up to me, filled with questions:\n‘Are you a fool, stranger —soft in the head and lazy too?\nOr do you let things slide because you like your pain?\nHere you are, cooped up on an island far too long,\nwith no way out of it, none that you can find,\nwhile all your shipmates’ spirit ebbs away.’\n420    So she prodded and I replied at once,\n‘Let me tell you, goddess —whoever you are —\nI’m hardly landlocked here of my own free will.\nSo I must have angered one of the deathless gods\nwho rule the skies up there. But you tell me —\nyou immortals know it all —which one of you\nblocks my way here, keeps me from my voyage?\nHow can I cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?’\nAnd the glistening goddess reassured me warmly,\n‘Of course, my friend, I’ll answer all your questions.\n430  Who haunts these parts? Proteus of Egypt does,\nthe immortal Old Man of the Sea who never lies,\nwho sounds the deep in all its depths, Poseidon’s servant.\nHe’s my father, they say, he gave me life. And he,\nif only you ambush him somehow and pin him down,\nwill tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage,\nhow you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last.\nAnd he can tell you too, if you want to press him —\nyou are a king, it seems —\nall that’s occurred within your palace, good and bad,\n440  while you’ve been gone your long and painful way.’\n‘Then you are the one’ —I quickly took her up.\n‘Show me the trick to trap this ancient power,\nor he’ll see or sense me first and slip away.\nIt’s hard for a mortal man to force a god.’\n‘True, my friend,’ the glistening one agreed,\n‘and again I’ll tell you all you need to know.\nWhen the sun stands striding at high noon,\nthen up from the waves he comes —\nthe Old Man of the Sea who never lies —\n450  under a West Wind’s gust that shrouds him round\nin shuddering dark swells, and once he’s out on land\nhe heads for his bed of rest in deep hollow caves\nand around him droves of seals —sleek pups bred\nby his lovely ocean-lady —bed down too\nin a huddle, flopping up from the gray surf,\ngiving off the sour reek of the salty ocean depths.\nI’ll lead you there myself at the break of day\nand couch you all for attack, side-by-side.\nChoose three men from your crew, choose well,\n460  the best you’ve got aboard the good decked hulls.\nNow I will tell you all the old wizard’s tricks . . .\nFirst he will make his rounds and count the seals\nand once he’s checked their number, reviewed them all,\ndown in their midst he’ll lie, like a shepherd with his flock.\nThat’s your moment. Soon as you see him bedded down,\nmuster your heart and strength and hold him fast,\nwildly as he writhes and fights you to escape.\nHe’ll try all kinds of escape —twist and turn\ninto every beast that moves across the earth,\n470  transforming himself into water, superhuman fire,\nbut you hold on for dear life, hug him all the harder!\nAnd when, at last, he begins to ask you questions —\nback in the shape you saw him sleep at first —\nrelax your grip and set the old god free\nand ask him outright, hero,\nwhich of the gods is up in arms against you?\nHow can you cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?’\nSo she urged and under the breaking surf she dove\nas I went back to our squadron beached in sand,\n480  my heart a heaving storm at every step . . .\nOnce I reached my ship hauled up on shore\nwe made our meal and the godsent night came down\nand then we slept at the sea’s smooth shelving edge.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nI set out down the coast of the wide-ranging sea,\npraying hard to the gods for all their help,\ntaking with me the three men I trusted most\non every kind of mission.\nEidothea, now,\nhad slipped beneath the sea’s engulfing folds\n490  but back from the waves she came with four sealskins,\nall freshly stripped, to deceive her father blind.\nShe scooped out lurking-places deep in the sand\nand sat there waiting as we approached her post,\nthen couching us side-by-side she flung a sealskin\nover each man’s back. Now there was an ambush\nthat would have overpowered us all —overpowering,\ntrue, the awful reek of all those sea-fed brutes!\nWho’d dream of bedding down with a monster of the deep?\nBut the goddess sped to our rescue, found the cure\n500  with ambrosia, daubing it under each man’s nose —\nthat lovely scent, it drowned the creatures’ stench.\nSo all morning we lay there waiting, spirits steeled,\nwhile seals came crowding, jostling out of the sea\nand flopped down in rows, basking along the surf.\nAt high noon the old man emerged from the waves\nand found his fat-fed seals and made his rounds,\ncounting them off, counting us the first four,\nbut he had no inkling of all the fraud afoot.\nThen down he lay and slept, but we with a battle-cry,\n510  we rushed him, flung our arms around him —he’d lost nothing,\nthe old rascal, none of his cunning quick techniques!\nFirst he shifted into a great bearded lion\nand then a serpent —\na panther —\na ramping wild boar —\na torrent of water —\na tree with soaring branchtops —\nbut we held on for dear life, braving it out\nuntil, at last, that quick-change artist,\nthe old wizard, began to weary of all this\nand burst out into rapid-fire questions:\n‘Which god, Menelaus, conspired with you\n520  to trap me in ambush? seize me against my will?\nWhat on earth do you want?’\n‘You know, old man,’\nI countered now. ‘Why put me off with questions?\nHere I am, cooped up on an island far too long,\nwith no way out of it, none that I can find,\nwhile my spirit ebbs away. But you tell me —\nyou immortals know it all —which one of you\nblocks my way here, keeps me from my voyage?\nHow can I cross the swarming sea and reach home at last?’\n‘How wrong you were!’ the seer shot back at once.\n530  ‘You should have offered Zeus and the other gods\na handsome sacrifice, then embarked, if you ever hoped\nfor a rapid journey home across the wine-dark sea.\nIt’s not your destiny yet to see your loved ones,\nreach your own grand house, your native land at last,\nnot till you sail back through Egyptian waters —\nthe great Nile swelled by the rains of Zeus —\nand make a splendid rite to the deathless gods\nwho rule the vaulting skies. Then, only then\nwill the gods grant you the voyage you desire.’\n540    So he urged, and broke the heart inside me,\nhaving to double back on the mist-bound seas,\nback to Egypt, that, that long and painful way . . .\nNevertheless I caught my breath and answered,\n‘That I will do, old man, as you command.\nBut tell me this as well, and leave out nothing:\nDid all the Achaeans reach home in the ships unharmed,\nall we left behind, Nestor and I, en route from Troy?\nOr did any die some cruel death by shipwreck\nor die in the arms of loved ones,\n550  once they’d wound down the long coil of war?’\nAnd he lost no time in saying, ‘Son of Atreus,\nwhy do you ask me that? Why do you need to know?\nWhy probe my mind? You won’t stay dry-eyed long,\nI warn you, once you have heard the whole story.\nMany of them were killed, many survived as well,\nbut only two who captained your bronze-armored units\ndied on the way home —you know who died in the fighting,\nyou were there yourself.\nAnd one is still alive,\nheld captive, somewhere, off in the endless seas . . .\nAjax, now, went down with his long-oared fleet.\nFirst Poseidon drove him onto the cliffs of Gyrae,\nlooming cliffs, then saved him from the breakers —\nhe’d have escaped his doom, too, despite Athena’s hate,\nif he hadn’t flung that brazen boast, the mad blind fool.\n“In the teeth of the gods,” he bragged, “I have escaped\nthe ocean’s sheer abyss!” Poseidon heard that frantic vaunt\nand the god grasped his trident in both his massive hands\nand struck the Gyraean headland, hacked the rock in two,\nand the giant stump stood fast but the jagged spur\n570  where Ajax perched at first, the raving madman —\ntoppling into the sea, it plunged him down, down\nin the vast, seething depths. And so he died,\nhaving drunk his fill of brine.\nYour brother?\nHe somehow escaped that fate; Agamemnon got away\nin his beaked ships. Queen Hera pulled him through.\nBut just as he came abreast of Malea’s beetling cape\na hurricane snatched him up and swept him way off course —\ngroaning, desperate —driving him over the fish-infested sea\nto the wild borderland where Thyestes made his home\n580  in the days of old and his son Aegisthus lived now.\nBut even from there a safe return seemed likely,\nyes, the immortals swung the wind around to fair\nand the victors sailed home. How he rejoiced,\nAtrides setting foot on his fatherland once more —\nhe took that native earth in his hands and kissed it,\nhot tears flooding his eyes, so thrilled to see his land!\nBut a watchman saw him too —from a lookout high above —\na spy that cunning Aegisthus stationed there,\nluring the man with two gold bars in payment.\nOne whole year he’d watched . . .\nso the great king would not get past unseen,\nhis fighting power intact for self-defense.\nThe spy ran the news to his master’s halls\nand Aegisthus quickly set his stealthy trap.\nPicking the twenty best recruits from town\nhe packed them in ambush at one end of the house,\nat the other he ordered a banquet dressed and spread\nand went to welcome the conquering hero, Agamemnon,\nwent with team and chariot, and a mind aswarm with evil.\n600  Up from the shore he led the king, he ushered him in —\nsuspecting nothing of all his doom —he feasted him well\nthen cut him down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough!\nNot one of your brother’s men-at-arms was left alive,\nnone of Aegisthus’ either. All, killed in the palace.’\nSo Proteus said, and his story crushed my heart.\nI knelt down in the sand and wept. I’d no desire\nto go on living and see the rising light of day.\nBut once I’d had my fill of tears and writhing there,\nthe Old Man of the Sea who never lies continued,\n610  ‘No more now, Menelaus. How long must you weep?\nWithering tears, what good can come of tears?\nNone I know of. Strive instead to return\nto your native country —hurry home at once!\nEither you’ll find the murderer still alive\nor Orestes will have beaten you to the kill.\nYou’ll be in time to share the funeral feast.’\nSo he pressed, and I felt my heart, my old pride,\nfor all my grieving, glow once more in my chest\nand I asked the seer in a rush of winging words,\n620  ‘Those two I know now. Tell me the third man’s name.\nWho is still alive, held captive off in the endless seas?\nUnless he’s dead by now. I want to know the truth\nthough it grieves me all the more.’\n‘Odysseus’ —\nthe old prophet named the third at once —\n‘Laertes’ son, who makes his home in Ithaca . . .\nI saw him once on an island, weeping live warm tears\nin the nymph Calypso’s house —she holds him there by force.\nHe has no way to voyage home to his own native land,\nno trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars\n630  and send him scudding over the sea’s broad back.\nBut about your own destiny, Menelaus,\ndear to Zeus, it’s not for you to die\nand meet your fate in the stallion-land of Argos,\nno, the deathless ones will sweep you off to the world’s end,\nthe Elysian Fields, where gold-haired Rhadamanthys waits,\nwhere life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man;\nno snow, no winter onslaught, never a downpour there\nbut night and day the Ocean River sends up breezes,\nsinging winds of the West refreshing all mankind.\n640  All this because you are Helen’s husband now —\nthe gods count you the son-in-law of Zeus.’\nSo he divined and down the breaking surf he dove\nas I went back to the ships with my brave men,\nmy heart a rising tide at every step.\nOnce I reached my craft hauled up on shore\nwe made our meal and the godsent night came down\nand then we slept at the sea’s smooth shelving edge.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nwe hauled the vessels down to the sunlit breakers first\n650  then stepped the masts amidships, canvas brailed —\nthe crews swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks\nand in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.\nBack we went to the Nile swelled by the rains of Zeus,\nI moored the ships and sacrificed in a splendid rite,\nand once I’d slaked the wrath of the everlasting gods\nI raised a mound for Agamemnon, his undying glory.\nAll this done, I set sail and the gods sent me\na stiff following wind that sped me home,\nhome to the native land I love.\n660  my boy, stay on in my palace now with me,\nat least till ten or a dozen days have passed.\nThen I’ll give you a princely send-off —shining gifts,\nthree stallions and a chariot burnished bright —\nand I’ll add a gorgeous cup so you can pour\nlibations out to the deathless gods on high\nand remember Menelaus all your days.”\nTelemachus,\nsummoning up his newfound tact, replied,\n“Please, Menelaus, don’t keep me quite so long.\nTrue, I’d gladly sit beside you one whole year\n670  without a twinge of longing for home or parents.\nIt’s wonderful how you tell your stories, all you say —\nI delight to listen! Yes, but now, I’m afraid,\nmy comrades must be restless in sacred Pylos,\nand here you’d hold me just a little longer.\nAs for the gift you give me, let it be a keepsake.\nThose horses I really cannot take to Ithaca;\nbetter to leave them here to be your glory.\nYou rule a wide level plain\nwhere the fields of clover roll and galingale\n680  and wheat and oats and glistening full-grain barley.\nNo running-room for mares in Ithaca, though, no meadows.\nGoat, not stallion, land, yet it means the world to me.\nNone of the rugged islands slanting down to sea\nis good for pasture or good for bridle paths,\nbut Ithaca, best of islands, crowns them all!”\nSo he declared. The lord of the warcry smiled,\npatted him with his hand and praised his guest, concluding,\n“Good blood runs in you, dear boy, your words are proof.\nCertainly I’ll exchange the gifts. The power’s mine.\n690  Of all the treasures lying heaped in my palace\nyou shall have the finest, most esteemed. Why,\nI’ll give you a mixing-bowl, forged to perfection —\nit’s solid silver finished off with a lip of gold.\nHephaestus made it himself. And a royal friend,\nPhaedimus, king of Sidon, lavished it on me\nwhen his palace welcomed me on passage home.\nHow pleased I’d be if you took it as a gift!”\nAnd now as the two confided in each other,\nbanqueters arrived at the great king’s palace,\n700  leading their own sheep, bearing their hearty wine,\nand their wives in lovely headbands sent along the food.\nAnd so they bustled about the halls preparing dinner . . .\nBut all the while the suitors, before Odysseus’ palace,\namused themselves with discus and long throwing spears,\nout on the leveled grounds, free and easy as always,\nfull of swagger. But lord Antinous sat apart,\ndashing Eurymachus beside him, ringleaders,\nhead and shoulders the strongest of the lot.\nPhronius’ son Noëmon approached them now,\n710  quick to press Antinous with a question:\n“Antinous, have we any notion or not\nwhen Telemachus will return from sandy Pylos?\nHe sailed in a ship of mine and now I need her back\nto cross over to Elis Plain where I keep a dozen horses,\nbrood-mares suckling some heavy-duty mules, unbroken.\nI’d like to drive one home and break him in.”\nThat dumbfounded them both. They never dreamed\nthe prince had gone to Pylos, Neleus’ city —\ncertain the boy was still nearby somewhere,\n720  out on his farm with flocks or with the swineherd.\n“Tell me the truth!” Antinous wheeled on Noëmon.\n“When did he go? And what young crew went with him?\nIthaca’s best? Or his own slaves and servants?\nSurely he has enough to man a ship.\nTell me this —be clear —I’ve got to know:\ndid he commandeer your ship against your will\nor did you volunteer it once he’d won you over?”\n“I volunteered it, of course,” Noëmon said.\n“What else could anyone do, when such a man,\n730  a prince weighed down with troubles,\nasked a favor? Hard to deny him anything.\nAnd the young crew that formed his escort? Well,\nthey’re the finest men on the island, next to us.\nAnd Mentor took command —I saw him climb aboard —\nor a god who looked like Mentor head to foot,\nand that’s what I find strange. I saw good Mentor\nyesterday, just at sunup, here. But clearly\nhe boarded ship for Pylos days ago.”\nWith that he headed back to his father’s house,\n740  leaving the two lords stiff with indignation.\nThey made the suitors sit down in a group\nand stop their games at once. Eupithes’ son\nAntinous rose up in their midst to speak,\nhis dark heart filled with fury,\nblazing with anger —eyes like searing fire:\n“By god, what a fine piece of work he’s carried off!\nTelemachus —what insolence —and we thought his little jaunt\nwould come to grief. But in spite of us all, look,\nthe young cub slips away, just like that —\n750  picks the best crew in the land and off he sails.\nAnd this is just the start of the trouble he can make.\nZeus kill that brazen boy before he hits his prime!\nQuick, fetch me a swift ship and twenty men —\nI’ll waylay him from ambush, board him coming back\nin the straits between Ithaca and rocky Same.\nThis gallant voyage of his to find his father\nwill find him wrecked at last!”\nThey all roared approval, urged him on,\nrose at once and retired to Odysseus’ palace.\n760    But not for long was Penelope unaware\nof the grim plots her suitors planned in secret.\nThe herald Medon told her. He’d overheard their schemes,\nlistening in outside the court while they wove on within.\nHe rushed the news through the halls to tell the queen\nwho greeted him as he crossed her chamber’s threshold:\n“Herald, why have the young blades sent you now?\nTo order King Odysseus’ serving-women\nto stop their work and slave to fix their feast?\nI hate their courting, their running riot here —\n770  would to god that this meal, here and now,\nwere their last meal on earth!\nDay after day,\nall of you swarming, draining our life’s blood,\nmy wary son’s estate. What, didn’t you listen\nto your fathers —when you were children, years ago —\ntelling you how Odysseus treated them, your parents?\nNever an unfair word, never an unfair action\namong his people here, though that’s the way\nof our god-appointed kings,\nhating one man, loving the next, with luck.\n780  Not Odysseus. Never an outrage done to any man alive.\nBut you, you and your ugly outbursts, shameful acts,\nthey’re plain to see. Look at the thanks he gets\nfor all past acts of kindness!”\nMedon replied,\nsure of his own discretion, “Ah my queen,\nif only that were the worst of all you face.\nNow your suitors are plotting something worse,\nharsher, crueler. God forbid they bring it off!\nThey’re poised to cut Telemachus down with bronze swords\non his way back home. He’s sailed off, you see . . .\n790  for news of his father —to sacred Pylos first,\nthen out to the sunny hills of Lacedaemon.”\nHer knees gave way on the spot, her heart too.\nShe stood there speechless a while, struck dumb,\ntears filling her eyes, her warm voice choked.\nAt last she found some words to make reply:\n“Oh herald, why has my child gone and left me?\nNo need in the world for him to board the ships,\nthose chariots of the sea that sweep men on,\ndriving across the ocean’s endless wastes . . .\n800  Does he want his very name wiped off the earth?”\nMedon, the soul of thoughtfulness, responded,\n“I don’t know if a god inspired your son\nor the boy’s own impulse led him down to Pylos,\nbut he went to learn of his father’s journey home,\nor whatever fate he’s met.”\nBack through King Odysseus’ house he went\nbut a cloud of heartbreak overwhelmed the queen.\nShe could bear no longer sitting on a chair\nthough her room had chairs aplenty.\n810  Down she sank on her well-built chamber’s floor,\nweeping, pitifully, as the women whimpered round her,\nall the women, young and old, who served her house.\nPenelope, sobbing uncontrollably, cried out to them,\n“Hear me, dear ones! Zeus has given me torment —\nme above all the others born and bred in my day.\nMy lionhearted husband, lost, long years ago,\nwho excelled the Argives all in every strength —\nthat great man whose fame resounds through Hellas\nright to the depths of Argos!\nBut now my son,\n820  my darling boy —the whirlwinds have ripped him\nout of the halls without a trace! I never heard\nhe’d gone —not even from you, you hard, heartless . . .\nnot one of you even thought to rouse me from my bed,\nthough well you knew when he boarded that black ship.\nOh if only I had learned he was planning such a journey,\nhe would have stayed, by god, keen as he was to sail —\nor left me dead right here within our palace.\nGo, someone, quickly! Call old Dolius now,\nthe servant my father gave me when I came,\n830  the man who tends my orchard green with trees,\nso he can run to Laertes, sit beside him,\ntell him the whole story, point by point.\nPerhaps —who knows? —he’ll weave some plan,\nhe’ll come out of hiding, plead with all these people\nmad to destroy his line, his son’s line of kings!”\n“Oh dear girl,” Eurycleia the fond old nurse replied,\n“kill me then with a bronze knife —no mercy —or let me live,\nhere in the palace —I’ll hide nothing from you now!\nI knew it all, I gave him all he asked for,\n840  bread and mellow wine, but he made me take\na binding oath that I, I wouldn’t tell you,\nno, not till ten or a dozen days had passed\nor you missed the lad yourself and learned he’d gone,\nso tears would never mar your lovely face . . .\nCome, bathe now, put on some fresh clothes,\nclimb to the upper rooms with all your women\nand pray to Pallas, daughter of storming Zeus —\nshe may save Telemachus yet, even at death’s door.\nDon’t worry an old man, worried enough by now.\n850  I can’t believe the blessed gods so hate\nthe heirs of King Arcesius, through and through.\nOne will still live on —I know it —born to rule\nthis lofty house and the green fields far and wide.”\nshe lulled Penelope’s grief and dried her eyes of tears.\nAnd the queen bathed and put fresh clothing on,\nclimbed to the upper rooms with all her women\nand sifting barley into a basket, prayed to Pallas,\n“Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder —\ntireless one, Athena! If ever, here in his halls,\n860  resourceful King Odysseus\nburned rich thighs of sheep or oxen in your honor,\noh remember it now for my sake, save my darling son,\ndefend him from these outrageous, overbearing suitors!”\nShe shrilled a high cry and the goddess heard her prayer\nas the suitors burst into uproar through the shadowed halls\nand one of the lusty young men began to brag, “Listen,\nour long-courted queen’s preparing us all a marriage —\nwith no glimmer at all\nhow the murder of her son has been decreed.”\nBoasting so,\n870  with no glimmer at all of what had been decreed.\nBut Antinous took the floor and issued orders:\n“Stupid fools! Muzzle your bragging now —\nbefore someone slips inside and reports us.\nUp now, not a sound, drive home our plan —\nit suits us well, we approved it one and all.”\nWith that he picked out twenty first-rate men\nand down they went to the swift ship at the sea’s edge.\nFirst they hauled the craft into deeper water,\nstepped the mast amidships, canvas brailed,\n880  made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps\nwhile zealous aides-in-arms brought weapons on.\nThey moored her well out in the channel, disembarked\nand took their meal on shore, waiting for dusk to fall.\nBut there in her upper rooms she lay, Penelope\nlost in thought, fasting, shunning food and drink,\nbrooding now . . . would her fine son escape his death\nor go down at her overweening suitors’ hands?\nHer mind in torment, wheeling\nlike some lion at bay, dreading gangs of hunters\n890  closing their cunning ring around him for the finish.\nHarried so she was, when a deep kind sleep overcame her,\nback she sank and slept, her limbs fell limp and still.\nAnd again the bright-eyed goddess Pallas thought\nof one more way to help. She made a phantom now,\nits build like a woman’s build, Iphthime’s, yes,\nanother daughter of generous Lord Icarius,\nEumelus’ bride, who made her home in Pherae.\nAthena sped her on to King Odysseus’ house\nto spare Penelope, worn with pain and sobbing,\n900  further spells of grief and storms of tears.\nThe phantom entered her bedroom,\npassing quickly in through the doorbolt slit\nand hovering at her head she rose and spoke now:\n“Sleeping, Penelope, your heart so wrung with sorrow?\nNo need, I tell you, no, the gods who live at ease\ncan’t bear to let you weep and rack your spirit.\nYour son will still come home —it is decreed.\nHe’s never wronged the gods in any way.”\nAnd Penelope murmured back, still cautious,\n910  drifting softly now at the gate of dreams,\n“Why have you come, my sister?\nYour visits all too rare in the past,\nfor you make your home so very far away.\nYou tell me to lay to rest the grief and tears\nthat overwhelm me now, torment me, heart and soul?\nWith my lionhearted husband lost long years ago,\nwho excelled the Argives all in every strength?\nThat great man whose fame resounds through Hellas\nright to the depths of Argos . . .\nAnd now my darling boy,\n920  he’s off and gone in a hollow ship! Just a youngster,\nstill untrained for war or stiff debate.\nHim I mourn even more than I do my husband —\nI quake in terror for all that he might suffer\neither on open sea or shores he goes to visit.\nHordes of enemies scheme against him now,\nkeen to kill him off\nbefore he can reach his native land again.”\n“Courage!” the shadowy phantom reassured her.\n“Don’t be overwhelmed by all your direst fears.\n930  He travels with such an escort, one that others\nwould pray to stand beside them. She has power —\nPallas Athena. She pities you in your tears.\nShe wings me here to tell you all these things.”\nBut the circumspect Penelope replied,\n“If you are a god and have heard a god’s own voice,\ncome, tell me about that luckless man as well.\nIs he still alive? does he see the light of day?\nOr is he dead already, lost in the House of Death?”\n“About that man,” the shadowy phantom answered,\n940  “I cannot tell you the story start to finish,\nwhether he’s dead or alive.\nIt’s wrong to lead you on with idle words.”\nshe glided off by the doorpost past the bolt —\ngone on a lifting breeze. Icarius’ daughter\nstarted up from sleep, her spirit warmed now\nthat a dream so clear had come to her in darkest night.\nBut the suitors boarded now and sailed the sea-lanes,\nplotting in their hearts Telemachus’ plunge to death.\nOff in the middle channel lies a rocky island,\n950  just between Ithaca and Same’s rugged cliffs —\nAsteris —not large, but it has a cove,\na harbor with two mouths where ships can hide.\nHere the Achaeans lurked in ambush for the prince."

    "text": "As Dawn rose up from bed by her lordly mate Tithonus,\nbringing light to immortal gods and mortal men,\nthe gods sat down in council, circling Zeus\nthe thunder king whose power rules the world.\nAthena began, recalling Odysseus to their thoughts,\nthe goddess deeply moved by the man’s long ordeal,\nheld captive still in the nymph Calypso’s house:\n“Father Zeus —you other happy gods who never die —\nnever let any sceptered king be kind and gentle now,\n10  not with all his heart, or set his mind on justice —\nno, let him be cruel and always practice outrage.\nThink: not one of the people whom he ruled\nremembers Odysseus now, that godlike man,\nand kindly as a father to his children.\nhe’s left to pine on an island, racked with grief\nin the nymph Calypso’s house —she holds him there by force.\nHe has no way to voyage home to his own native land,\nno trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars\nand send him scudding over the sea’s broad back.\n20  And now his dear son . . . they plot to kill the boy\non his way back home. Yes, he has sailed off\nfor news of his father, to holy Pylos first,\nthen out to the sunny hills of Lacedaemon.”\n“My child,” Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied,\n“what nonsense you let slip through your teeth. Come now,\nwasn’t the plan your own? You conceived it yourself:\nOdysseus shall return and pay the traitors back.\nTelemachus? Sail him home with all your skill —\nthe power is yours, no doubt —\n30  home to his native country all unharmed\nwhile the suitors limp to port, defeated, baffled men.”\nWith those words, Zeus turned to his own son Hermes.\n“You are our messenger, Hermes, sent on all our missions.\nAnnounce to the nymph with lovely braids our fixed decree:\nOdysseus journeys home —the exile must return.\nBut not in the convoy of the gods or mortal men.\nNo, on a lashed, makeshift raft and wrung with pains,\non the twentieth day he will make his landfall, fertile Scheria,\nthe land of Phaeacians, close kin to the gods themselves,\n40  who with all their hearts will prize him like a god\nand send him off in a ship to his own beloved land,\ngiving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes —\nmore plunder than he could ever have won from Troy\nif Odysseus had returned intact with his fair share.\nSo his destiny ordains. He shall see his loved ones,\nreach his high-roofed house, his native land at last.”\nSo Zeus decreed and the giant-killing guide obeyed at once.\nQuickly under his feet he fastened the supple sandals,\never-glowing gold, that wing him over the waves\n50  and boundless earth with the rush of gusting winds.\nHe seized the wand that enchants the eyes of men\nwhenever Hermes wants, or wakes us up from sleep.\nThat wand in his grip, the powerful giant-killer,\nswooping down from Pieria, down the high clear air,\nplunged to the sea and skimmed the waves like a tern\nthat down the deadly gulfs of the barren salt swells\nglides and dives for fish,\ndipping its beating wings in bursts of spray —\nso Hermes skimmed the crests on endless crests.\nBut once he gained that island worlds apart,\nup from the deep-blue sea he climbed to dry land\nand strode on till he reached the spacious cave\nwhere the nymph with lovely braids had made her home,\nand he found her there inside . . .\nA great fire\nblazed on the hearth and the smell of cedar\ncleanly split and sweetwood burning bright\nwafted a cloud of fragrance down the island.\nDeep inside she sang, the goddess Calypso, lifting\nher breathtaking voice as she glided back and forth\n70  before her loom, her golden shuttle weaving.\nThick, luxuriant woods grew round the cave,\nalders and black poplars, pungent cypress too,\nand there birds roosted, folding their long wings,\nowls and hawks and the spread-beaked ravens of the sea,\nblack skimmers who make their living off the waves.\nAnd round the mouth of the cavern trailed a vine\nladen with clusters, bursting with ripe grapes.\nFour springs in a row, bubbling clear and cold,\nrunning side-by-side, took channels left and right.\n80  Soft meadows spreading round were starred with violets,\nlush with beds of parsley. Why, even a deathless god\nwho came upon that place would gaze in wonder,\nheart entranced with pleasure. Hermes the guide,\nthe mighty giant-killer, stood there, spellbound . . .\nBut once he’d had his fill of marveling at it all\nhe briskly entered the deep vaulted cavern.\nCalypso, lustrous goddess, knew him at once,\nas soon as she saw his features face-to-face.\nImmortals are never strangers to each other,\n90  no matter how distant one may make her home.\nBut as for great Odysseus —\nHermes could not find him within the cave.\nOff he sat on a headland, weeping there as always,\nwrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish,\ngazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears.\nBut Calypso, lustrous goddess, questioned Hermes,\nseating him on a glistening, polished chair.\n“God of the golden wand, why have you come?\nA beloved, honored friend,\n100  but it’s been so long, your visits much too rare.\nTell me what’s on your mind. I’m eager to do it,\nwhatever I can do . . . whatever can be done.”\nAnd the goddess drew a table up beside him,\nheaped with ambrosia, mixed him deep-red nectar.\nHermes the guide and giant-killer ate and drank.\nOnce he had dined and fortified himself with food\nhe launched right in, replying to her questions:\n“As one god to another, you ask me why I’ve come.\nI’ll tell you the whole story, mince no words —\n110  your wish is my command.\nIt was Zeus who made me come, no choice of mine.\nWho would willingly roam across a salty waste so vast,\nso endless? Think: no city of men in sight, and not a soul\nto offer the gods a sacrifice and burn the fattest victims.\nBut there is no way, you know, for another god to thwart\nthe will of storming Zeus and make it come to nothing.\nZeus claims you keep beside you a most unlucky man,\nmost harried of all who fought for Priam’s Troy\nnine years, sacking the city in the tenth,\n120  and then set sail for home.\nBut voyaging back they outraged Queen Athena\nwho loosed the gales and pounding seas against them.\nThere all the rest of his loyal shipmates died\nbut the wind drove him on, the current bore him here.\nNow Zeus commands you to send him off with all good speed:\nit is not his fate to die here, far from his own people.\nDestiny still ordains that he shall see his loved ones,\nreach his high-roofed house, his native land at last.”\nBut lustrous Calypso shuddered at those words\n130  and burst into a flight of indignation. “Hard-hearted\nyou are, you gods! You unrivaled lords of jealousy —\nscandalized when goddesses sleep with mortals,\nopenly, even when one has made the man her husband.\nSo when Dawn with her rose-red fingers took Orion,\nyou gods in your everlasting ease were horrified\ntill chaste Artemis throned in gold attacked him,\nout on Delos, shot him to death with gentle shafts.\nAnd so when Demeter the graceful one with lovely braids\ngave way to her passion and made love with Iasion,\n140  bedding down in a furrow plowed three times —\nZeus got wind of it soon enough, I’d say,\nand blasted the man to death with flashing bolts.\nSo now at last, you gods, you train your spite on me\nfor keeping a mortal man beside me. The man I saved,\nriding astride his keel-board, all alone, when Zeus\nwith one hurl of a white-hot bolt had crushed\nhis racing warship down the wine-dark sea.\nThere all the rest of his loyal shipmates died\nbut the wind drove him on, the current bore him here.\n150  And I welcomed him warmly, cherished him, even vowed\nto make the man immortal, ageless, all his days . . .\nBut since there is no way for another god to thwart\nthe will of storming Zeus and make it come to nothing,\nlet the man go —if the Almighty insists, commands —\nand destroy himself on the barren salt sea!\nI’ll send him off, but not with any escort.\nI have no ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars\nand send him scudding over the sea’s broad back.\nBut I will gladly advise him —I’ll hide nothing —\n160  so he can reach his native country all unharmed.”\nAnd the guide and giant-killer reinforced her words:\n“Release him at once, just so. Steer clear of the rage of Zeus!\nOr down the years he’ll fume and make your life a hell.”\nWith that the powerful giant-killer sped away.\nThe queenly nymph sought out the great Odysseus —\nthe commands of Zeus still ringing in her ears —\nand found him there on the headland, sitting, still,\nweeping, his eyes never dry, his sweet life flowing away\nwith the tears he wept for his foiled journey home,\n170  since the nymph no longer pleased. In the nights, true,\nhe’d sleep with her in the arching cave —he had no choice —\nunwilling lover alongside lover all too willing . . .\nBut all his days he’d sit on the rocks and beaches,\nwrenching his heart with sobs and groans and anguish,\ngazing out over the barren sea through blinding tears.\nSo coming up to him now, the lustrous goddess ventured,\n“No need, my unlucky one, to grieve here any longer,\nno, don’t waste your life away. Now I am willing,\nheart and soul, to send you off at last. Come,\n180  take bronze tools, cut your lengthy timbers,\nmake them into a broad-beamed raft\nand top it off with a half-deck high enough\nto sweep you free and clear on the misty seas.\nAnd I myself will stock her with food and water,\nruddy wine to your taste —all to stave off hunger —\ngive you clothing, send you a stiff following wind\nso you can reach your native country all unharmed.\nIf only the gods are willing. They rule the vaulting skies.\nThey’re stronger than I to plan and drive things home.”\n190    Long-enduring Odysseus shuddered at that\nand broke out in a sharp flight of protest.\n“Passage home? Never. Surely you’re plotting\nsomething else, goddess, urging me —in a raft —\nto cross the ocean’s mighty gulfs. So vast, so full\nof danger not even deep-sea ships can make it through,\nswift as they are and buoyed up by the winds of Zeus himself.\nI won’t set foot on a raft until you show good faith,\nuntil you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath\nyou’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!”\n200    He was so intense the lustrous goddess smiled,\nstroked him with her hand, savored his name and chided,\n“Ah what a wicked man you are, and never at a loss.\nWhat a thing to imagine, what a thing to say!\nEarth be my witness now, the vaulting Sky above\nand the dark cascading waters of the Styx —I swear\nby the greatest, grimmest oath that binds the happy gods:\nI will never plot some new intrigue to harm you.\nNever. All I have in mind and devise for you\nare the very plans I’d fashion for myself\n210  if I were in your straits. My every impulse\nbends to what is right. Not iron, trust me,\nthe heart within my breast. I am all compassion.”\nAnd lustrous Calypso quickly led the way\nas he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.\nThey reached the arching cavern, man and god as one,\nand Odysseus took the seat that Hermes just left,\nwhile the nymph set out before him every kind\nof food and drink that mortal men will take.\nCalypso sat down face-to-face with the king\n220  and the women served her nectar and ambrosia.\nThey reached out for the good things that lay at hand\nand when they’d had their fill of food and drink\nthe lustrous one took up a new approach. “So then,\nroyal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of exploits,\nstill eager to leave at once and hurry back\nto your own home, your beloved native land?\nGood luck to you, even so. Farewell!\nBut if you only knew, down deep, what pains\nare fated to fill your cup before you reach that shore,\n230  you’d stay right here, preside in our house with me\nand be immortal. Much as you long to see your wife,\nthe one you pine for all your days . . . and yet\nI just might claim to be nothing less than she,\nneither in face nor figure. Hardly right, is it,\nfor mortal woman to rival immortal goddess?\nHow, in build? in beauty?”\n“Ah great goddess,”\nworldly Odysseus answered, “don’t be angry with me,\nplease. All that you say is true, how well I know.\nLook at my wise Penelope. She falls far short of you,\n240  your beauty, stature. She is mortal after all\nand you, you never age or die . . .\nNevertheless I long —I pine, all my days —\nto travel home and see the dawn of my return.\nAnd if a god will wreck me yet again on the wine-dark sea,\nI can bear that too, with a spirit tempered to endure.\nMuch have I suffered, labored long and hard by now\nin the waves and wars. Add this to the total —\nbring the trial on!”\nEven as he spoke\nthe sun set and the darkness swept the earth.\n250  And now, withdrawing into the cavern’s deep recesses,\nlong in each other’s arms they lost themselves in love.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nOdysseus quickly dressed himself in cloak and shirt\nwhile the nymph slipped on a loose, glistening robe,\nfilmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist\nshe ran a brocaded golden belt\nand over her head a scarf to shield her brow,\nthen turned to plan the great man’s voyage home.\nShe gave him a heavy bronze ax that fit his grip,\n260  both blades well-honed, with a fine olive haft\nlashed firm to its head. She gave him a polished\nsmoothing-adze as well and then she led the way\nto the island’s outer edge where trees grew tall,\nalders, black poplars and firs that shot sky-high,\nseasoned, drying for years, ideal for easy floating.\nOnce she’d shown her guest where the tall timber stood,\nCalypso the lustrous goddess headed home again.\nHe set to cutting trunks —the work was done in no time.\nTwenty in all he felled, he trimmed them clean with his ax\n270  and split them deftly, trued them straight to the line.\nMeanwhile the radiant goddess brought him drills —\nhe bored through all his planks and wedged them snugly,\nknocking them home together, locked with pegs and joints.\nBroad in the beam and bottom flat as a merchantman\nwhen a master shipwright turns out her hull,\nso broad the craft Odysseus made himself.\nWorking away at speed\nhe put up half-decks pinned to close-set ribs\nand a sweep of gunwales rounded off the sides.\n280  He fashioned the mast next and sank its yard in deep\nand added a steering-oar to hold her right on course,\nthen he fenced her stem to stern with twigs and wicker,\nbulwark against the sea-surge, floored with heaps of brush.\nAnd lustrous Calypso came again, now with bolts of cloth\nto make the sail, and he finished that off too, expertly.\nBraces, sheets and brails —he rigged all fast on board,\nthen eased her down with levers into the sunlit sea.\nThat was the fourth day and all his work was done.\nOn the fifth, the lovely goddess launched him from her island,\n290  once she had bathed and decked him out in fragrant clothes.\nAnd Calypso stowed two skins aboard —dark wine in one,\nthe larger one held water —added a sack of rations,\nfilled with her choicest meats to build his strength,\nand summoned a wind to bear him onward, fair and warm.\nThe wind lifting his spirits high, royal Odysseus\nspread sail —gripping the tiller, seated astern —\nand now the master mariner steered his craft,\nsleep never closing his eyes, forever scanning\nthe stars, the Pleiades and the Plowman late to set\nand the Great Bear that mankind also calls the Wagon:\nshe wheels on her axis always fixed, watching the Hunter,\nand she alone is denied a plunge in the Ocean’s baths.\nHers were the stars the lustrous goddess told him\nto keep hard to port as he cut across the sea.\nAnd seventeen days he sailed, making headway well;\non the eighteenth, shadowy mountains slowly loomed . . .\nthe Phaeacians’ island reaching toward him now,\nover the misty breakers, rising like a shield.\nBut now Poseidon, god of the earthquake, saw him —\njust returning home from his Ethiopian friends,\nfrom miles away on the Solymi mountain-range\nhe spied Odysseus sailing down the sea\nand it made his fury boil even more.\nHe shook his head and rumbled to himself,\n“Outrageous! Look how the gods have changed their minds\nabout Odysseus —while I was off with my Ethiopians.\nJust look at him there, nearing Phaeacia’s shores\nwhere he’s fated to escape his noose of pain\nthat’s held him until now. Still my hopes ride high —\n320  I’ll give that man his swamping fill of trouble!”\nWith that he rammed the clouds together —both hands\nclutching his trident —churned the waves into chaos, whipping\nall the gales from every quarter, shrouding over in thunderheads\nthe earth and sea at once —and night swept down from the sky —\nEast and South Winds clashed and the raging West and North,\nsprung from the heavens, roiled heaving breakers up —\nand Odysseus’ knees quaked, his spirit too;\nnumb with fear he spoke to his own great heart:\n“Wretched man —what becomes of me now, at last?\n330  I fear the nymph foretold it all too well —\non the high seas, she said, before I can reach\nmy native land I’ll fill my cup of pain! And now,\nlook, it all comes to pass. What monstrous clouds —\nKing Zeus crowning the whole wide heaven black —\nchurning the seas in chaos, gales blasting,\nraging around my head from every quarter —\nmy death-plunge in a flash, it’s certain now!\nThree, four times blessed, my friends-in-arms\nwho died on the plains of Troy those years ago,\n340  serving the sons of Atreus to the end. Would to god\nI’d died there too and met my fate that day the Trojans,\nswarms of them, hurled at me with bronze spears,\nfighting over the corpse of proud Achilles!\nA hero’s funeral then, my glory spread by comrades —\nnow what a wretched death I’m doomed to die!”\nAt that a massive wave came crashing down on his head,\na terrific onslaught spinning his craft round and round —\nhe was thrown clear of the decks —\nthe steering-oar wrenched\nfrom his grasp —\nand in one lightning attack the brawling\n350  galewinds struck full-force, snapping the mast mid-shaft\nand hurling the sail and sailyard far across the sea.\nHe went under a good long while, no fast way out,\nno struggling up from under the giant wave’s assault,\nhis clothing dragged him down —divine Calypso’s gifts —\nbut at last he fought his way to the surface spewing\nbitter brine, streams of it pouring down his head.\nBut half-drowned as he was, he’d not forget his craft —\nhe lunged after her through the breakers, laying hold\nand huddling amidships, fled the stroke of death.\n360  Pell-mell the rollers tossed her along down-current,\nwild as the North Wind tossing thistle along the fields\nat high harvest —dry stalks clutching each other tightly —\nso the galewinds tumbled her down the sea, this way, that way,\nnow the South Wind flinging her over to North to sport with,\nnow the East Wind giving her up to West to harry on and on.\nBut someone saw him —Cadmus’ daughter with lovely ankles,\nIno, a mortal woman once with human voice and called\nLeucothea now she lives in the sea’s salt depths,\nesteemed by all the gods as she deserves.\n370  She pitied Odysseus, tossed, tormented so —\nshe broke from the waves like a shearwater on the wing,\nlit on the wreck and asked him kindly, “Ah poor man,\nwhy is the god of earthquakes so dead set against you?\nStrewing your way with such a crop of troubles!\nBut he can’t destroy you, not for all his anger.\nJust do as I say. You seem no fool to me.\nStrip off those clothes and leave your craft\nfor the winds to hurl, and swim for it now, you must,\nstrike out with your arms for landfall there,\n380  Phaeacian land where destined safety waits.\nHere, take this scarf,\ntie it around your waist —it is immortal.\nNothing to fear now, neither pain nor death.\nBut once you grasp the mainland with your hands\nuntie it quickly, throw it into the wine-dark sea,\nfar from the shore, but you, you turn your head away!”\nWith that the goddess handed him the scarf\nand slipped back in the heavy breaking seas\nlike a shearwater once again\n390  and a dark heaving billow closed above her.\nBut battle-weary Odysseus weighed two courses,\ndeeply torn, probing his fighting spirit: “Oh no —\nI fear another immortal weaves a snare to trap me,\nurging me to abandon ship! I won’t. Not yet.\nThat shore’s too far away —\nI glimpsed it myself —where she says refuge waits.\nNo, here’s what I’ll do, it’s what seems best to me.\nAs long as the timbers cling and joints stand fast,\nI’ll hold out aboard her and take a whipping —\n400  once the breakers smash my craft to pieces,\nthen I’ll swim —no better plan for now.”\nBut just as great Odysseus thrashed things out,\nPoseidon god of the earthquake launched a colossal wave,\nterrible, murderous, arching over him, pounding down on him,\nhard as a windstorm blasting piles of dry parched chaff,\nscattering flying husks —so the long planks of his boat\nwere scattered far and wide. But Odysseus leapt aboard\none timber and riding it like a plunging racehorse\nstripped away his clothes, divine Calypso’s gifts,\n410  and quickly tying the scarf around his waist\nhe dove headfirst in the sea,\nstretched his arms and stroked for life itself.\nBut again the mighty god of earthquakes spied him,\nshook his head and grumbled deep in his spirit, “Go, go,\nafter all you’ve suffered —rove your miles of sea —\ntill you fall in the arms of people loved by Zeus.\nEven so I can hardly think you’ll find\nyour punishments too light!”\nWith that threat\nhe lashed his team with their long flowing manes,\ngaining Aegae port where his famous palace stands.\nBut Zeus’s daughter Athena countered him at once.\nThe rest of the winds she stopped right in their tracks,\ncommanding them all to hush now, go to sleep.\nAll but the boisterous North —she whipped him up\nand the goddess beat the breakers flat before Odysseus,\ndear to Zeus, so he could reach the Phaeacians,\nmingle with men who love their long oars\nand escape his death at last.\nYes, but now,\nadrift on the heaving swells two nights, two days —\n430  quite lost —again and again the man foresaw his death.\nThen when Dawn with her lovely locks brought on\nthe third day, the wind fell in an instant,\nall glazed to a dead calm, and Odysseus,\nscanning sharply, raised high by a groundswell,\nlooked up and saw it —landfall, just ahead.\nJoy . . . warm as the joy that children feel\nwhen they see their father’s life dawn again,\none who’s lain on a sickbed racked with torment,\nwasting away, slowly, under some angry power’s onslaught —\n440  then what joy when the gods deliver him from his pains!\nSo warm, Odysseus’ joy when he saw that shore, those trees,\nas he swam on, anxious to plant his feet on solid ground again.\nBut just offshore, as far as a man’s shout can carry,\nhe caught the boom of a heavy surf on jagged reefs —\nroaring breakers crashing down on an ironbound coast,\nexploding in fury —\nthe whole sea shrouded —\nsheets of spray —\nno harbors to hold ships, no roadstead where they’d ride,\nnothing but jutting headlands, riptooth reefs, cliffs.\nOdysseus’ knees quaked and the heart inside him sank;\n450  he spoke to his fighting spirit, desperate: “Worse and worse!\nNow that Zeus has granted a glimpse of land beyond my hopes,\nnow I’ve crossed this waste of water, the end in sight,\nthere’s no way out of the boiling surf —I see no way!\nRugged reefs offshore, around them breakers roaring,\nabove them a smooth rock face, rising steeply, look,\nand the surge too deep inshore, no spot to stand\non my own two legs and battle free of death.\nIf I clamber out, some big comber will hoist me,\ndash me against that cliff —my struggles all a waste!\n460  If I keep on swimming down the coast, trying to find\na seabeach shelving against the waves, a sheltered cove —\nI dread it —another gale will snatch me up and haul me\nback to the fish-infested sea, retching in despair.\nOr a dark power will loose some monster at me,\nrearing out of the waves —one of the thousands\nAmphitrite’s breakers teem with. Well I know\nthe famous god of earthquakes hates my very name!”\nJust as that fear went churning through his mind\na tremendous roller swept him toward the rocky coast\n470  where he’d have been flayed alive, his bones crushed\nif the bright-eyed goddess Pallas had not inspired him now.\nHe lunged for a reef, he seized it with both hands and clung\nfor dear life, groaning until the giant wave surged past\nand so he escaped its force, but the breaker’s backwash\ncharged into him full fury and hurled him out to sea.\nLike pebbles stuck in the suckers of some octopus\ndragged from its lair —so strips of skin torn\nfrom his clawing hands stuck to the rock face.\nA heavy sea covered him over, then and there\n480  unlucky Odysseus would have met his death —\nagainst the will of Fate —\nbut the bright-eyed one inspired him yet again.\nFighting out from the breakers pounding toward the coast,\nout of danger he swam on, scanning the land, trying to find\na seabeach shelving against the waves, a sheltered cove,\nand stroking hard he came abreast of a river’s mouth,\nrunning calmly, the perfect spot, he thought . . .\nfree of rocks, with a windbreak from the gales.\nAs the current flowed he felt the river’s god and\n490  prayed to him in spirit: “Hear me, lord, whoever you are,\nI’ve come to you, the answer to all my prayers —\nrescue me from the sea, the Sea-lord’s curse!\nEven immortal gods will show a man respect,\nwhatever wanderer seeks their help —like me —\nI throw myself on your mercy, on your current now —\nI have suffered greatly. Pity me, lord,\nyour suppliant cries for help!”\nSo the man prayed\nand the god stemmed his current, held his surge at once\nand smoothing out the swells before Odysseus now,\n500  drew him safe to shore at the river’s mouth.\nHis knees buckled, massive arms fell limp,\nthe sea had beaten down his striving heart.\nHis whole body swollen, brine aplenty gushing\nout of his mouth and nostrils —breathless, speechless,\nthere he lay, with only a little strength left in him,\ndeathly waves of exhaustion overwhelmed him now . . .\nBut once he regained his breath and rallied back to life,\nat last he loosed the goddess’ scarf from his body,\ndropped it into the river flowing out to sea\n510  and a swift current bore it far downstream\nand suddenly Ino caught it in her hands.\nStruggling up from the banks, he flung himself\nin the deep reeds, he kissed the good green earth\nand addressed his fighting spirit, desperate still:\n“Man of misery, what next? Is this the end?\nIf I wait out a long tense night by the banks,\nI fear the sharp frost and the soaking dew together\nwill do me in —I’m bone-weary, about to breathe my last,\nand a cold wind blows from a river on toward morning.\n520  But what if I climb that slope, go for the dark woods\nand bed down in the thick brush? What if I’m spared\nthe chill, fatigue, and a sweet sleep comes my way?\nI fear wild beasts will drag me off as quarry.”\nBut this was the better course, it struck him now.\nHe set out for the woods and not far from the water\nfound a grove with a clearing all around and crawled\nbeneath two bushy olives sprung from the same root,\none olive wild, the other well-bred stock.\nNo sodden gusty winds could ever pierce them,\n530  nor could the sun’s sharp rays invade their depths,\nnor could a downpour drench them through and through,\nso dense they grew together, tangling side-by-side.\nOdysseus crept beneath them, scraping up at once\na good wide bed for himself with both hands.\nA fine litter of dead leaves had drifted in,\nenough to cover two men over, even three,\nin the wildest kind of winter known to man.\nLong-enduring great Odysseus, overjoyed at the sight,\nbedded down in the midst and heaped the leaves around him.\n540  As a man will bury his glowing brand in black ashes,\noff on a lonely farmstead, no neighbors near,\nto keep a spark alive —no need to kindle fire\nfrom somewhere else —so great Odysseus buried\nhimself in leaves and Athena showered sleep\nupon his eyes . . . sleep in a swift wave\ndelivering him from all his pains and labors,\nblessed sleep that sealed his eyes at last."

    "text": "So there he lay at rest, the storm-tossed great Odysseus,\nborne down by his hard labors first and now deep sleep\nas Athena traveled through the countryside\nand reached the Phaeacians’ city. Years ago\nthey lived in a land of spacious dancing-circles,\nHyperia, all too close to the overbearing Cyclops,\nstronger, violent brutes who harried them without end.\nSo their godlike king, Nausithous, led the people off\nin a vast migration, settled them in Scheria,\n10  far from the men who toil on this earth —\nhe flung up walls around the city, built the houses,\nraised the gods’ temples and shared the land for plowing.\nBut his fate had long since forced him down to Death\nand now Alcinous ruled, and the gods made him wise.\nStraight to his house the clear-eyed Pallas went,\nfull of plans for great Odysseus’ journey home.\nShe made her way to the gaily painted room\nwhere a young girl lay asleep . . .\na match for the deathless gods in build and beauty,\nNausicaa, the daughter of generous King Alcinous.\nTwo handmaids fair as the Graces slept beside her,\nflanking the two posts, with the gleaming doors closed.\nBut the goddess drifted through like a breath of fresh air,\nrushed to the girl’s bed and hovering close she spoke,\nin face and form like the shipman Dymas’ daughter,\na girl the princess’ age, and dearest to her heart.\nDisguised, the bright-eyed goddess chided, “Nausicaa,\nhow could your mother bear a careless girl like you?\nLook at your fine clothes, lying here neglected —\n30  with your marriage not far off,\nthe day you should be decked in all your glory\nand offer elegant dress to those who form your escort.\nThat’s how a bride’s good name goes out across the world\nand it brings her father and queenly mother joy. Come,\nlet’s go wash these clothes at the break of day —\nI’ll help you, lend a hand, and the work will fly!\nYou won’t stay unwed long. The noblest men\nin the country court you now, all Phaeacians\njust like you, Phaeacia-born and raised. So come,\n40  the first thing in the morning press your kingly father\nto harness the mules and wagon for you, all to carry\nyour sashes, dresses, glossy spreads for your bed.\nIt’s so much nicer for you to ride than go on foot.\nThe washing-pools are just too far from town.”\nthe bright-eyed goddess sped away to Olympus, where,\nthey say, the gods’ eternal mansion stands unmoved,\nnever rocked by galewinds, never drenched by rains,\nnor do the drifting snows assail it, no, the clear air\nstretches away without a cloud, and a great radiance\n50  plays across that world where the blithe gods\nlive all their days in bliss. There Athena went,\nonce the bright-eyed one had urged the princess on.\nDawn soon rose on her splendid throne and woke\nNausicaa finely gowned. Still beguiled by her dream,\ndown she went through the house to tell her parents now,\nher beloved father and mother. She found them both inside.\nHer mother sat at the hearth with several waiting-women,\nspinning yarn on a spindle, lustrous sea-blue wool.\nHer father she met as he left to join the lords\n60  at a council island nobles asked him to attend.\nShe stepped up close to him, confiding, “Daddy dear,\nI wonder, won’t you have them harness a wagon for me,\nthe tall one with the good smooth wheels . . . so I\ncan take our clothes to the river for a washing?\nLovely things, but lying before me all soiled.\nAnd you yourself, sitting among the princes,\ndebating points at your council,\nyou really should be wearing spotless linen.\nThen you have five sons, full-grown in the palace,\n70  two of them married, but three are lusty bachelors\nalways demanding crisp shirts fresh from the wash\nwhen they go out to dance. Look at my duties —\nthat all rests on me.”\nSo she coaxed, too shy\nto touch on her hopes for marriage, young warm hopes,\nin her father’s presence. But he saw through it all\nand answered quickly, “I won’t deny you the mules,\nmy darling girl . . . I won’t deny you anything.\nOff you go, and the men will harness a wagon,\nthe tall one with the good smooth wheels,\nfitted out with a cradle on the top.”\n80                                          With that\nhe called to the stablemen and they complied.\nThey trundled the wagon out now, rolling smoothly,\nbacked the mule-team into the traces, hitched them up,\nwhile the princess brought her finery from the room\nand piled it into the wagon’s polished cradle.\nHer mother packed a hamper —treats of all kinds,\nfavorite things to refresh her daughter’s spirits —\npoured wine in a skin, and as Nausicaa climbed aboard,\nthe queen gave her a golden flask of suppling olive oil\n90  for her and her maids to smooth on after bathing.\nThen, taking the whip in hand and glistening reins,\nshe touched the mules to a start and out they clattered,\ntrotting on at a clip, bearing the princess and her clothes\nand not alone: her maids went with her, stepping briskly too.\nOnce they reached the banks of the river flowing strong\nwhere the pools would never fail, with plenty of water\ncool and clear, bubbling up and rushing through\nto scour the darkest stains —they loosed the mules,\nout from under the wagon yoke, and chased them down\n100  the river’s rippling banks to graze on luscious clover.\nDown from the cradle they lifted clothes by the armload,\nplunged them into the dark pools and stamped them down\nin the hollows, one girl racing the next to finish first\nuntil they’d scoured and rinsed off all the grime,\nthen they spread them out in a line along the beach\nwhere the surf had washed a pebbly scree ashore.\nAnd once they’d bathed and smoothed their skin with oil,\nthey took their picnic, sitting along the river’s banks\nand waiting for all the clothes to dry in the hot noon sun.\n110  Now fed to their hearts’ content, the princess and her retinue\nthrew their veils to the wind, struck up a game of ball.\nWhite-armed Nausicaa led their singing, dancing beat . . .\nas lithe as Artemis with her arrows striding down\nfrom a high peak —Taygetus’ towering ridge or Erymanthus —\nthrilled to race with the wild boar or bounding deer,\nand nymphs of the hills race with her,\ndaughters of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder,\nranging the hills in sport, and Leto’s heart exults\nas head and shoulders over the rest her daughter rises,\n120  unmistakable —she outshines them all, though all are lovely.\nSo Nausicaa shone among her maids, a virgin, still unwed.\nBut now, as she was about to fold her clothes\nand yoke the mules and turn for home again,\nnow clear-eyed Pallas thought of what came next,\nto make Odysseus wake and see this young beauty\nand she would lead him to the Phaeacians’ town.\nthe princess suddenly tossed it to a maid\nbut it missed the girl, it splashed in a deep swirling pool\nand they all shouted out —\nand that woke great Odysseus.\n130  He sat up with a start, puzzling, his heart pounding:\n“Man of misery, whose land have I lit on now?\nWhat are they here —violent, savage, lawless?\nor friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?\nListen: shouting, echoing round me —women, girls —\nor the nymphs who haunt the rugged mountaintops\nand the river springs and meadows lush with grass!\nOr am I really close to people who speak my language?\nUp with you, see how the land lies, see for yourself now . . .”\nMuttering so, great Odysseus crept out of the bushes,\n140  stripping off with his massive hand a leafy branch\nfrom the tangled olive growth to shield his body,\nhide his private parts. And out he stalked\nas a mountain lion exultant in his power\nstrides through wind and rain and his eyes blaze\nand he charges sheep or oxen or chases wild deer\nbut his hunger drives him on to go for flocks,\neven to raid the best-defended homestead.\nSo Odysseus moved out . . .\nabout to mingle with all those lovely girls,\n150  naked now as he was, for the need drove him on,\na terrible sight, all crusted, caked with brine —\nthey scattered in panic down the jutting beaches.\nOnly Alcinous’ daughter held fast, for Athena planted\ncourage within her heart, dissolved the trembling in her limbs,\nand she firmly stood her ground and faced Odysseus, torn now —\nShould he fling his arms around her knees, the young beauty,\nplead for help, or stand back, plead with a winning word,\nbeg her to lead him to the town and lend him clothing?\nThis was the better way, he thought. Plead now\n160  with a subtle, winning word and stand well back,\ndon’t clasp her knees, the girl might bridle, yes.\nHe launched in at once, endearing, sly and suave:\n“Here I am at your mercy, princess —\nare you a goddess or a mortal? If one of the gods\nwho rule the skies up there, you’re Artemis to the life,\nthe daughter of mighty Zeus —I see her now —just look\nat your build, your bearing, your lithe flowing grace . . .\nBut if you’re one of the mortals living here on earth,\nthree times blest are your father, your queenly mother,\n170  three times over your brothers too. How often their hearts\nmust warm with joy to see you striding into the dances —\nsuch a bloom of beauty. True, but he is the one\nmore blest than all other men alive, that man\nwho sways you with gifts and leads you home, his bride!\nI have never laid eyes on anyone like you,\nneither man nor woman . . .\nI look at you and a sense of wonder takes me.\nonce I saw the like —in Delos, beside Apollo’s altar —\nthe young slip of a palm-tree springing into the light.\n180  There I’d sailed, you see, with a great army in my wake,\nout on the long campaign that doomed my life to hardship.\nThat vision! Just as I stood there gazing, rapt, for hours . . .\nno shaft like that had ever risen up from the earth —\nso now I marvel at you, my lady: rapt, enthralled,\ntoo struck with awe to grasp you by the knees\nthough pain has ground me down.\nOnly yesterday,\nthe twentieth day, did I escape the wine-dark sea.\nTill then the waves and the rushing gales had swept me on\nfrom the island of Ogygia. Now some power has tossed me here,\n190  doubtless to suffer still more torments on your shores.\nI can’t believe they’ll stop. Long before that\nthe gods will give me more, still more.\nCompassion —\nprincess, please! You, after all that I have suffered,\nyou are the first I’ve come to. I know no one else,\nnone in your city, no one in your land.\nShow me the way to town, give me a rag for cover,\njust some cloth, some wrapper you carried with you here.\nAnd may the good gods give you all your heart desires:\nhusband, and house, and lasting harmony too.\n200  No finer, greater gift in the world than that . . .\nwhen man and woman possess their home, two minds,\ntwo hearts that work as one. Despair to their enemies,\na joy to all their friends. Their own best claim to glory.”\n“Stranger,” the white-armed princess answered staunchly,\n“friend, you’re hardly a wicked man, and no fool, I’d say —\nit’s Olympian Zeus himself who hands our fortunes out,\nto each of us in turn, to the good and bad,\nhowever Zeus prefers . . .\nHe gave you pain, it seems. You simply have to bear it.\n210  But now, seeing you’ve reached our city and our land,\nyou’ll never lack for clothing or any other gift,\nthe right of worn-out suppliants come our way.\nI’ll show you our town, tell you our people’s name.\nPhaeacians we are, who hold this city and this land,\nand I am the daughter of generous King Alcinous.\nAll our people’s power stems from him.”\nShe called out to her girls with lovely braids:\n“Stop, my friends! Why run when you see a man?\nSurely you don’t think him an enemy, do you?\n220  There’s no one alive, there never will be one,\nwho’d reach Phaeacian soil and lay it waste.\nThe immortals love us far too much for that.\nWe live too far apart, out in the surging sea,\noff at the world’s end —\nno other mortals come to mingle with us.\nBut here’s an unlucky wanderer strayed our way\nand we must tend him well. Every stranger and beggar\ncomes from Zeus, and whatever scrap we give him\nhe’ll be glad to get. So, quick, my girls,\n230  give our newfound friend some food and drink\nand bathe the man in the river,\nwherever you find some shelter from the wind.”\nthey came to a halt and teased each other on\nand led Odysseus down to a sheltered spot\nwhere he could find a seat,\njust as great Alcinous’ daughter told them.\nThey laid out cloak and shirt for him to wear,\nthey gave him the golden flask of suppling olive oil\nand pressed him to bathe himself in the river’s stream.\n240  Then thoughtful Odysseus reassured the handmaids,\n“Stand where you are, dear girls, a good way off,\nso I can rinse the brine from my shoulders now\nand rub myself with oil . . .\nhow long it’s been since oil touched my skin!\nBut I won’t bathe in front of you. I would be embarrassed —\nstark naked before young girls with lovely braids.”\nThe handmaids scurried off to tell their mistress.\nGreat Odysseus bathed in the river, scrubbed his body\nclean of brine that clung to his back and broad shoulders,\n250  scoured away the brackish scurf that caked his head.\nAnd then, once he had bathed all over, rubbed in oil\nand donned the clothes the virgin princess gave him,\nZeus’s daughter Athena made him taller to all eyes,\nhis build more massive now, and down from his brow\nshe ran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters\nfull of blooms. As a master craftsman washes\ngold over beaten silver —a man the god of fire\nand Queen Athena trained in every fine technique —\nand finishes off his latest effort, handsome work,\n260  so she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now.\nAnd down to the beach he walked and sat apart,\nglistening in his glory, breathtaking, yes,\nand the princess gazed in wonder . . .\nthen turned to her maids with lovely braided hair:\n“Listen, my white-armed girls, to what I tell you.\nThe gods of Olympus can’t be all against this man\nwho’s come to mingle among our noble people.\nAt first he seemed appalling, I must say —\nnow he seems like a god who rules the skies up there!\n270  Ah, if only a man like that were called my husband,\nlived right here, pleased to stay forever . . .\nGive the stranger food and drink, my girls.”\nThey hung on her words and did her will at once,\nset before Odysseus food and drink, and he ate and drank,\nthe great Odysseus, long deprived, so ravenous now —\nit seemed like years since he had tasted food.\nThe white-armed princess thought of one last thing.\nFolding the clothes, she packed them into her painted wagon,\nhitched the sharp-hoofed mules, and climbing up herself,\n280  Nausicaa urged Odysseus, warmly urged her guest,\n“Up with you now, my friend, and off to town we go.\nI’ll see you into my wise father’s palace where,\nI promise you, you’ll meet all the best Phaeacians.\nWait, let’s do it this way. You seem no fool to me.\nWhile we’re passing along the fields and plowlands,\nyou follow the mules and wagon, stepping briskly\nwith all my maids. I’ll lead the way myself.\nBut once we reach our city, ringed by walls\nand strong high towers too, with a fine harbor either side . . .\n290  and the causeway in is narrow; along the road the rolling ships\nare all hauled up, with a slipway cleared for every vessel.\nThere’s our assembly, round Poseidon’s royal precinct,\nbuilt of quarried slabs planted deep in the earth.\nHere the sailors tend their black ships’ tackle,\ncables and sails, and plane their oarblades down.\nPhaeacians, you see, care nothing for bow or quiver,\nonly for masts and oars and good trim ships themselves —\nwe glory in our ships, crossing the foaming seas!\nBut I shrink from all our sea-dogs’ nasty gossip.\n300  Some old salt might mock us behind our backs —\nwe have our share of insolent types in town\nand one of the coarser sort, spying us, might say,\n‘Now who’s that tall, handsome stranger Nausicaa has in tow?\nWhere’d she light on him? Her husband-to-be, just wait!\nBut who —some shipwrecked stray she’s taken up with,\nsome alien from abroad? Since nobody lives nearby.\nUnless it’s really a god come down from the blue\nto answer all her prayers, and to have her all his days.\nGood riddance! Let the girl go roving to find herself\n310  a man from foreign parts. She only spurns her own —\ncountless Phaeacians round about who court her,\nnothing but our best.’\nSo they’ll scoff . . .\njust think of the scandal that would face me then.\nI’d find fault with a girl who carried on that way,\nflouting her parents’ wishes —father, mother, still alive —\nconsorting with men before she’d tied the knot in public.\nNo, stranger, listen closely to what I say, the sooner\nto win your swift voyage home at my father’s hands.\nNow, you’ll find a splendid grove along the road —\n320  poplars, sacred to Pallas —\na bubbling spring’s inside and meadows run around it.\nThere lies my father’s estate, his blossoming orchard too,\nas far from town as a man’s strong shout can carry.\nTake a seat there, wait a while, and give us time\nto make it into town and reach my father’s house.\nThen, when you think we’re home, walk on yourself\nto the city, ask the way to my father’s palace,\ngenerous King Alcinous. You cannot miss it,\neven an innocent child could guide you there.\n330  No other Phaeacian’s house is built like that:\nso grand, the palace of Alcinous, our great hero.\nOnce the mansion and courtyard have enclosed you, go,\nquickly, across the hall until you reach my mother.\nBeside the hearth she sits in the fire’s glare,\nspinning yarn on a spindle, sea-blue wool —\na stirring sight, you’ll see . . .\nshe leans against a pillar, her ladies sit behind.\nAnd my father’s throne is drawn up close beside her;\nthere he sits and takes his wine, a mortal like a god.\n340  Go past him, grasp my mother’s knees —if you want\nto see the day of your return, rejoicing, soon,\neven if your home’s a world away.\nIf only the queen will take you to her heart,\nthen there’s hope that you will see your loved ones,\nreach your own grand house, your native land at last.”\nAt that she touched the mules with her shining whip\nand they quickly left the running stream behind.\nThe team trotted on, their hoofs wove in and out.\nShe drove them back with care so all the rest,\n350  maids and Odysseus, could keep the pace on foot,\nand she used the whip discreetly.\nThe sun sank as they reached the hallowed grove,\nsacred to Athena, where Odysseus stopped and sat\nand said a prayer at once to mighty Zeus’s daughter:\n“Hear me, daughter of Zeus whose shield is thunder —\ntireless one, Athena! Now hear my prayer at last,\nfor you never heard me then, when I was shattered,\nwhen the famous god of earthquakes wrecked my craft.\nGrant that here among the Phaeacian people\n360  I may find some mercy and some love!”\nSo he prayed and Athena heard his prayer\nbut would not yet appear to him undisguised.\nShe stood in awe of her Father’s brother, lord of the sea\nwho still seethed on, still churning with rage against\nthe great Odysseus till he reached his native land."

    "text": "Now as Odysseus, long an exile, prayed in Athena’s grove,\nthe hardy mule-team drew the princess toward the city.\nReaching her father’s splendid halls, she reined in,\njust at the gates —her brothers clustering round her,\nmen like gods, released the mules from the yoke\nand brought the clothes indoors\nas Nausicaa made her way toward her bedroom.\nThere her chambermaid lit a fire for her —\nEurymedusa, the old woman who’d come from Apiraea\n10  years ago, when the rolling ships had sailed her in\nand the country picked her out as King Alcinous’ prize,\nfor he ruled all the Phaeacians, they obeyed him like a god.\nOnce, she had nursed the white-armed princess in the palace.\nNow she lit a fire and made her supper in the room.\nAt the same time, Odysseus set off toward the city.\nPallas Athena, harboring kindness for the hero,\ndrifted a heavy mist around him, shielding him\nfrom any swaggering islander who’d cross his path,\nprovoke him with taunts and search out who he was.\n20  Instead, as he was about to enter the welcome city,\nthe bright-eyed goddess herself came up to greet him there,\nfor all the world like a young girl, holding a pitcher,\nstanding face-to-face with the visitor, who asked,\n“Little girl, now wouldn’t you be my guide\nto the palace of the one they call Alcinous?\nThe king who rules the people of these parts.\nI am a stranger, you see, weighed down with troubles,\ncome this way from a distant, far-off shore.\nSo I know no one here, none at all\nin your city and the farmlands round about.”\n30                                                 “Oh yes, sir,\ngood old stranger,” the bright-eyed goddess said,\n“I’ll show you the very palace that you’re after —\nthe king lives right beside my noble father.\nCome, quietly too, and I will lead the way.\nNow not a glance at anyone, not a question.\nThe men here never suffer strangers gladly,\nhave no love for hosting a man from foreign lands.\nAll they really trust are their fast, flying ships\nthat cross the mighty ocean. Gifts of Poseidon,\n40  ah what ships they are —\nquick as a bird, quick as a darting thought!”\nAnd Pallas Athena sped away in the lead\nas he followed in her footsteps, man and goddess.\nBut the famed Phaeacian sailors never saw him,\nright in their midst, striding down their streets.\nAthena the one with lovely braids would not permit it,\nthe awesome goddess poured an enchanted mist around him,\nharboring kindness for Odysseus in her heart.\nAnd he marveled now at the balanced ships and havens,\n50  the meeting grounds of the great lords and the long ramparts\nlooming, coped and crowned with palisades of stakes —\nan amazing sight to see . . .\nAnd once they reached the king’s resplendent halls\nthe bright-eyed goddess cried out, “Good old stranger,\nhere, here is the very palace that you’re after —\nI’ve guided you all the way. Here you’ll find\nour princes dear to the gods, busy feasting.\nYou go on inside. Be bold, nothing to fear.\nIn every venture the bold man comes off best,\n60  even the wanderer, bound from distant shores.\nThe queen is the first you’ll light on in the halls.\nArete, she is called, and earns the name:\nshe answers all our prayers. She comes, in fact,\nfrom the same stock that bred our King Alcinous.\nFirst came Nausithous, son of the earthquake god\nPoseidon and Periboea, the lovely, matchless beauty,\nthe youngest daughter of iron-willed Eurymedon,\nking of the overweening Giants years ago.\nHe led that reckless clan to its own ruin,\n70  killed himself in the bargain, but the Sea-lord\nlay in love with Periboea and she produced a son,\nNausithous, that lionheart who ruled Phaeacia well.\nNow, Nausithous had two sons, Rhexenor and Alcinous,\nbut the lord of the silver bow, Apollo, shot Rhexenor down —\nmarried, true, yet still without a son in the halls,\nhe left one child behind, a daughter named Arete.\nAlcinous made the girl his wife and honors her\nas no woman is honored on this earth, of all the wives\nnow keeping households under their husbands’ sway.\n80  Such is her pride of place, and always will be so:\ndear to her loving children, to Alcinous himself\nand all our people. They gaze on her as a god,\nsaluting her warmly on her walks through town.\nShe lacks nothing in good sense and judgment —\nshe can dissolve quarrels, even among men,\nwhoever wins her sympathies.\nIf only our queen will take you to her heart,\nthen there’s hope that you will see your loved ones,\nreach your high-roofed house, your native land at last.”\n90    And with that vow the bright-eyed goddess sped away,\nover the barren sea, leaving welcome Scheria far behind,\nand reaching Marathon and the spacious streets of Athens,\nentered Erechtheus’ sturdy halls, Athena’s stronghold.\nNow as Odysseus approached Alcinous’ famous house\na rush of feelings stirred within his heart,\nbringing him to a standstill,\neven before he crossed the bronze threshold . . .\nA radiance strong as the moon or rising sun came flooding\nthrough the high-roofed halls of generous King Alcinous.\n100  Walls plated in bronze, crowned with a circling frieze\nglazed as blue as lapis, ran to left and right\nfrom outer gates to the deepest court recess,\nand solid golden doors enclosed the palace.\nUp from the bronze threshold silver doorposts rose\nwith silver lintel above, and golden handle hooks.\nAnd dogs of gold and silver were stationed either side,\nforged by the god of fire with all his cunning craft\nto keep watch on generous King Alcinous’ palace,\nhis immortal guard-dogs, ageless, all their days.\n110  Inside to left and right, in a long unbroken row\nfrom farthest outer gate to the inmost chamber,\nthrones stood backed against the wall, each draped\nwith a finely spun brocade, women’s handsome work.\nHere the Phaeacian lords would sit enthroned,\ndining, drinking —the feast flowed on forever.\nAnd young boys, molded of gold, set on pedestals\nstanding firm, were lifting torches high in their hands\nto flare through the nights and light the feasters down the hall.\nAnd Alcinous has some fifty serving-women in his house:\n120  some, turning the handmill, grind the apple-yellow grain,\nsome weave at their webs or sit and spin their yarn,\nfingers flickering quick as aspen leaves in the wind\nand the densely woven woolens dripping oil droplets.\nJust as Phaeacian men excel the world at sailing,\ndriving their swift ships on the open seas,\nso the women excel at all the arts of weaving.\nThat is Athena’s gift to them beyond all others —\na genius for lovely work, and a fine mind too.\nOutside the courtyard, fronting the high gates,\n130  a magnificent orchard stretches four acres deep\nwith a strong fence running round it side-to-side.\nHere luxuriant trees are always in their prime,\npomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red,\nsucculent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark.\nAnd the yield of all these trees will never flag or die,\nneither in winter nor in summer, a harvest all year round\nfor the West Wind always breathing through will bring\nsome fruits to the bud and others warm to ripeness —\npear mellowing ripe on pear, apple on apple,\n140  cluster of grapes on cluster, fig crowding fig.\nAnd here is a teeming vineyard planted for the kings,\nbeyond it an open level bank where the vintage grapes\nlie baking to raisins in the sun while pickers gather others;\nsome they trample down in vats, and here in the front rows\nbunches of unripe grapes have hardly shed their blooms\nwhile others under the sunlight slowly darken purple.\nAnd there by the last rows are beds of greens,\nbordered and plotted, greens of every kind,\nglistening fresh, year in, year out. And last,\n150  there are two springs, one rippling in channels\nover the whole orchard —the other, flanking it,\nrushes under the palace gates\nto bubble up in front of the lofty roofs\nwhere the city people come and draw their water.\nwere the gifts, the glories showered down by the gods\non King Alcinous’ realm.\nAnd there Odysseus stood,\ngazing at all this bounty, a man who’d borne so much . . .\nOnce he’d had his fill of marveling at it all,\nhe crossed the threshold quickly,\n160  strode inside the palace. Here he found\nthe Phaeacian lords and captains tipping out\nlibations now to the guide and giant-killer Hermes,\nthe god to whom they would always pour the final cup\nbefore they sought their beds. Odysseus went on\nstriding down the hall, the man of many struggles\nshrouded still in the mist Athena drifted round him,\ntill he reached Arete and Alcinous the king. And then,\nthe moment he flung his arms around Arete’s knees,\nthe godsent mist rolled back to reveal the great man.\n170  And silence seized the feasters all along the hall —\nseeing him right before their eyes, they marveled,\ngazing on him now as Odysseus pleaded, “Queen,\nArete, daughter of godlike King Rhexenor!\nHere after many trials I come to beg for mercy,\nyour husband’s, yours, and all these feasters’ here.\nMay the gods endow them with fortune all their lives,\nmay each hand down to his sons the riches in his house\nand the pride of place the realm has granted him.\nBut as for myself, grant me a rapid convoy home\n180  to my own native land. How far away I’ve been\nfrom all my loved ones —how long I have suffered!”\nPleading so, the man sank down in the ashes,\njust at the hearth beside the blazing fire,\nwhile all the rest stayed hushed, stock-still.\nAt last the old revered Echeneus broke the spell,\nthe eldest lord in Phaeacia, finest speaker too,\na past master at all the island’s ancient ways.\nImpelled by kindness now, he rose and said,\n“This is no way, Alcinous. How indecent, look,\n190  our guest on the ground, in the ashes by the fire!\nYour people are holding back, waiting for your signal.\nCome, raise him up and seat the stranger now,\nin a silver-studded chair,\nand tell the heralds to mix more wine for all\nso we can pour out cups to Zeus who loves the lightning,\nchampion of suppliants —suppliants’ rights are sacred.\nAnd let the housekeeper give our guest his supper,\nunstinting with her stores.”\nHearing that,\nAlcinous, poised in all his majesty, took the hand\n200  of the seasoned, worldly-wise Odysseus, raised him up\nfrom the hearth and sat him down in a burnished chair,\ndisplacing his own son, the courtly Lord Laodamas\nwho had sat beside him, the son he loved the most.\nA maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher\nand over a silver basin tipped it out\nso the guest might rinse his hands,\nthen pulled a gleaming table to his side.\nA staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve him,\nappetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.\n210  As long-suffering great Odysseus ate and drank,\nthe hallowed King Alcinous called his herald:\n“Come, Pontonous! Mix the wine in the bowl,\npour rounds to all our banqueters in the house\nso we can pour out cups to Zeus who loves the lightning,\nchampion of suppliants —suppliants’ rights are sacred.”\nAt that Pontonous mixed the heady, honeyed wine\nand tipped first drops for the god in every cup,\nthen poured full rounds for all. And once they’d poured\nlibations out and drunk to their hearts’ content,\n220  Alcinous rose and addressed his island people:\n“Hear me, lords and captains of Phaeacia,\nhear what the heart inside me has to say.\nNow, our feast finished, home you go to sleep.\nBut at dawn we call the elders in to full assembly,\nhost our guest in the palace, sacrifice to the gods\nand then we turn our minds to his passage home,\nso under our convoy our new friend can travel back\nto his own land —no toil, no troubles —soon,\nrejoicing, even if his home’s a world away.\n230  And on the way no pain or hardship suffered,\nnot till he sets foot on native ground again.\nThere in the future he must suffer all that Fate\nand the overbearing Spinners spun out on his life line\nthe very day his mother gave him birth . . . But if\nhe’s one of the deathless powers, out of the blue,\nthe gods are working now in strange, new ways.\nAlways, up to now, they came to us face-to-face\nwhenever we’d give them grand, glorious sacrifices —\nthey always sat beside us here and shared our feasts.\n240  Even when some lonely traveler meets them on the roads,\nthey never disguise themselves. We’re too close kin for that,\nclose as the wild Giants are, the Cyclops too.”\n“Alcinous!”\nwary Odysseus countered, “cross that thought from your mind.\nI’m nothing like the immortal gods who rule the skies,\neither in build or breeding. I’m just a mortal man.\nWhom do you know most saddled down with sorrow?\nThey are the ones I’d equal, grief for grief.\nAnd I could tell a tale of still more hardship,\nall I’ve suffered, thanks to the gods’ will.\n250  But despite my misery, let me finish dinner.\nThe belly’s a shameless dog, there’s nothing worse.\nAlways insisting, pressing, it never lets us forget —\ndestroyed as I am, my heart racked with sadness,\nsick with anguish, still it keeps demanding,\n‘Eat, drink!’ It blots out all the memory\nof my pain, commanding, ‘Fill me up!’\nat the first light of day, hurry, please,\nto set your unlucky guest on his own home soil.\nHow much I have suffered . . . Oh just let me see\n260  my lands, my serving-men and the grand high-roofed house —\nthen I can die in peace.”\nAll burst into applause,\nurging passage home for their newfound friend,\nhis pleading rang so true. And once they’d poured\nlibations out and drunk to their hearts’ content,\neach one made his way to rest in his own house.\nBut King Odysseus still remained at hall,\nseated beside the royal Alcinous and Arete\nas servants cleared the cups and plates away.\nThe white-armed Queen Arete took the lead;\n270  she’d spotted the cape and shirt Odysseus wore,\nfine clothes she’d made herself with all her women,\nso now her words flew brusquely, sharply: “Stranger,\nI’ll be the first to question you —myself.\nWho are you? Where are you from?\nWho gave you the clothes you’re wearing now?\nDidn’t you say you reached us roving on the sea?”\n“What hard labor, queen,” the man of craft replied,\n“to tell you the story of my troubles start to finish.\nThe gods on high have given me my share.\n280  Still, this much I will tell you . . .\nseeing you probe and press me so intently.\nThere is an island, Ogygia, lying far at sea,\nwhere the daughter of Atlas, Calypso, has her home,\nthe seductive nymph with lovely braids —a danger too,\nand no one, god or mortal, dares approach her there. But I,\ncursed as I am, some power brought me to her hearth,\nalone, when Zeus with a white-hot bolt had crushed\nmy racing warship down the wine-dark sea.\nThere all the rest of my loyal shipmates died\n290  but I, locking my arms around my good ship’s keel,\ndrifted along nine days. On the tenth, at dead of night,\nthe gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso’s island,\nhome of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids,\nand the goddess took me in in all her kindness,\nwelcomed me warmly, cherished me, even vowed\nto make me immortal, ageless, all my days —\nbut she never won the heart inside me, never.\nSeven endless years I remained there, always drenching\nwith my tears the immortal clothes Calypso gave me.\n300  Then, at last, when the eighth came wheeling round,\nshe insisted that I sail —inspired by warnings sent\nfrom Zeus, perhaps, or her own mind had changed.\nShe saw me on my way in a solid craft,\ntight and trim, and gave me full provisions,\nfood and mellow wine, immortal clothes to wear\nand summoned a wind to bear me onward, fair and warm.\nAnd seventeen days I sailed, making headway well;\non the eighteenth, shadowy mountains slowly loomed . . .\nyour land! My heart leapt up, unlucky as I am,\n310  doomed to be comrade still to many hardships.\nMany pains the god of earthquakes piled upon me,\nloosing the winds against me, blocking passage through,\nheaving up a terrific sea, beyond belief —nor did the whitecaps\nlet me cling to my craft, for all my desperate groaning.\nNo, the squalls shattered her stem to stern, but I,\nI swam hard, I plowed my way through those dark gulfs\ntill at last the wind and current bore me to your shores.\nBut here, had I tried to land, the breakers would have hurled me,\nsmashed me against the jagged cliffs of that grim coast,\n320  so I pulled away, swam back till I reached a river,\nthe perfect spot at last, or so it struck me,\nfree of rocks, with a windbreak from the gales.\nSo, fighting for life, I flung myself ashore\nand the godsent, bracing night came on at once.\nClambering up from the river, big with Zeus’s rains,\nI bedded down in the brush, my body heaped with leaves,\nand a god poured down a boundless sleep upon me, yes,\nand there in the leaves, exhausted, sick at heart,\nI slept the whole night through\n330  and on to the break of day and on into high noon\nand the sun was wheeling down when sweet sleep set me free.\nAnd I looked up, and there were your daughter’s maids\nat play on the beach, and she, she moved among them\nlike a deathless goddess! I begged her for help\nand not once did her sense of tact desert her;\nshe behaved as you’d never hope to find\nin one so young, not in a random meeting —\ntime and again the youngsters prove so flighty.\nNot she. She gave me food aplenty and shining wine,\n340  a bath in the river too, and gave me all this clothing.\nThat’s my whole story. Wrenching to tell, but true.”\n“Ah, but in one regard, my friend,” the king replied,\n“her good sense missed the mark, this daughter of mine.\nShe never escorted you to our house with all her maids\nbut she was the first you asked for care and shelter.”\n“Your majesty,” diplomatic Odysseus answered,\n“don’t find fault with a flawless daughter now,\nnot for my sake, please.\nShe urged me herself to follow with her maids.\n350  I chose not to, fearing embarrassment in fact —\nwhat if you took offense, seeing us both together?\nSuspicious we are, we men who walk the earth.”\n“Oh no, my friend,” Alcinous stated flatly,\n“I’m hardly a man for reckless, idle anger.\nBalance is best in all things.\nFather Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo! if only —\nseeing the man you are, seeing we think as one —\nyou could wed my daughter and be my son-in-law\nand stay right here with us. I’d give you a house\n360  and great wealth —if you chose to stay, that is.\nNo Phaeacian would hold you back by force.\nThe curse of Father Zeus on such a thing!\nAnd about your convoy home, you rest assured:\nI have chosen the day and I decree it is tomorrow.\nAnd all that voyage long you’ll lie in a deep sleep\nwhile my people sail you on through calm and gentle tides\ntill you reach your land and house, or any place you please.\nTrue, even if landfall lies more distant than Euboea,\noff at the edge of the world . . .\n370  So say our crews, at least, who saw it once,\nthat time they carried the gold-haired Rhadamanthys\nout to visit Tityus, son of Mother Earth. Imagine,\nthere they sailed and back they came in the same day,\nthey finished the homeward run with no strain at all.\nYou’ll see for yourself how far they top the best —\nmy ships and their young shipmates\ntossing up the whitecaps with their oars!”\nSo he vowed\nand the long-enduring great Odysseus glowed with joy\nand raised a prayer and called the god by name:\n“Father Zeus on high —\n380  may the king fulfill his promises one and all!\nThen his fame would ring through the fertile earth\nand never die —and I should reach my native land at last!”\nAnd now as the two men exchanged their hopes,\nthe white-armed queen instructed her palace maids\nto make a bed in the porch’s shelter, lay down\nsome heavy purple throws for the bed itself,\nand over it spread some blankets, thick woolly robes,\na warm covering laid on top. Torches in hand,\nthey left the hall and fell to work at once,\n390  briskly prepared a good snug resting-place\nand then returned to Odysseus, urged the guest,\n“Up, friend, time for sleep. Your bed is made.”\nHow welcome the thought of sleep to that man now . . .\nSo there after many trials Odysseus lay at rest\non a corded bed inside the echoing colonnade.\nAlcinous slept in chambers deep in his lofty house\nwhere the queen his wife arranged and shared their bed."

    "text": "When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nroyal Alcinous, hallowed island king, rose from bed\nand great Odysseus, raider of cities, rose too.\nPoised in his majesty, Alcinous led the way\nto Phaeacia’s meeting grounds, built for all\nbeside the harbored ships. Both men sat down\non the polished stone benches side-by-side\nas Athena started roaming up and down the town,\nin build and voice the wise Alcinous’ herald,\n10  furthering plans for Odysseus’ journey home,\nand stopped beside each citizen, urged them all,\n“Come this way, you lords and captains of Phaeacia,\ncome to the meeting grounds and learn about the stranger!\nA new arrival! Here at our wise king’s palace now,\nhe’s here from roving the ocean, driven far off course —\nhe looks like a deathless god!”\nRousing their zeal,\ntheir curiosity, each and every man, and soon enough\nthe assembly seats were filled with people thronging,\ngazing in wonder at the seasoned man of war . . .\n20  Over Odysseus’ head and shoulders now\nAthena lavished a marvelous splendor, yes,\nmaking him taller, more massive to all eyes,\nso Phaeacians might regard the man with kindness,\nawe and respect as well, and he might win through\nthe many trials they’d pose to test the hero’s strength.\nOnce they’d grouped, crowding the meeting grounds,\nAlcinous rose and addressed his island people:\n“Hear me, lords and captains of Phaeacia,\nhear what the heart inside me has to say.\n30  This stranger here, our guest —\nI don’t know who he is, or whether he comes\nfrom sunrise lands or the western lands of evening,\nbut he has come in his wanderings to my palace;\nhe pleads for passage, he begs we guarantee it.\nSo now, as in years gone by, let us press on\nand grant him escort. No one, I tell you, no one\nwho comes to my house will languish long here,\nheartsick for convoy home.\nCome, my people!\nHaul a black ship down to the bright sea,\n40  rigged for her maiden voyage —\nenlist a crew of fifty-two young sailors,\nthe best in town, who’ve proved their strength before.\nLet all hands lash their oars to the thwarts then disembark,\ncome to my house and fall in for a banquet, quickly.\nI’ll lay on a princely feast for all. So then,\nthese are the orders I issue to our crews.\nFor the rest, you sceptered princes here,\nyou come to my royal halls so we can give\nthis stranger a hero’s welcome in our palace —\n50  no one here refuse. Call in the inspired bard\nDemodocus. God has given the man the gift of song,\nto him beyond all others, the power to please,\nhowever the spirit stirs him on to sing.”\nWith those commands Alcinous led the way\nand a file of sceptered princes took his lead\nwhile the herald went to find the gifted bard.\nAnd the fifty-two young sailors, duly chosen,\nbriskly following orders,\nwent down to the shore of the barren salt sea.\n60  And once they reached the ship at the surf’s edge,\nfirst they hauled the craft into deeper water,\nstepped the mast amidships, canvas brailed,\nthey made oars fast in the leather oarlock straps,\nmoored her riding high on the swell, then disembarked\nand made their way to wise Alcinous’ high-roofed halls.\nThere colonnades and courts and rooms were overflowing\nwith crowds, a mounting host of people young and old.\nThe king slaughtered a dozen sheep to feed his guests,\neight boars with shining tusks and a pair of shambling oxen.\n70  These they skinned and dressed, and then laid out a feast\nto fill the heart with savor.\nIn came the herald now,\nleading along the faithful bard the Muse adored\nabove all others, true, but her gifts were mixed\nwith good and evil both: she stripped him of sight\nbut gave the man the power of stirring, rapturous song.\nPontonous brought the bard a silver-studded chair,\nright amid the feasters, leaning it up against\na central column —hung his high clear lyre\non a peg above his head and showed him how\n80  to reach up with his hands and lift it down.\nAnd the herald placed a table by his side\nwith a basket full of bread and cup of wine\nfor him to sip when his spirit craved refreshment.\nAll reached out for the good things that lay at hand\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nthe Muse inspired the bard\nto sing the famous deeds of fighting heroes —\nthe song whose fame had reached the skies those days:\nThe Strife Between Odysseus and Achilles, Peleus’ Son . . .\n90  how once at the gods’ lavish feast the captains clashed\nin a savage war of words, while Agamemnon, lord of armies,\nrejoiced at heart that Achaea’s bravest men were battling so.\nFor this was the victory sign that Apollo prophesied\nat his shrine in Pytho when Agamemnon strode across\nthe rocky threshold, asking the oracle for advice —\nthe start of the tidal waves of ruin tumbling down\non Troy’s and Achaea’s forces, both at once,\nthanks to the will of Zeus who rules the world.\nThat was the song the famous harper sang\n100  but Odysseus, clutching his flaring sea-blue cape\nin both powerful hands, drew it over his head\nand buried his handsome face,\nashamed his hosts might see him shedding tears.\nWhenever the rapt bard would pause in the song,\nhe’d lift the cape from his head, wipe off his tears\nand hoisting his double-handled cup, pour it out to the gods.\nBut soon as the bard would start again, impelled to sing\nby Phaeacia’s lords, who reveled in his tale,\nagain Odysseus hid his face and wept.\n110  His weeping went unmarked by all the others;\nonly Alcinous, sitting close beside him,\nnoticed his guest’s tears,\nheard the groan in the man’s labored breathing\nand said at once to the master mariners around him,\n“Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia!\nBy now we’ve had our fill of food well-shared\nand the lyre too, our loyal friend at banquets.\nNow out we go again and test ourselves in contests,\ngames of every kind —so our guest can tell his friends,\n120  when he reaches home, how far we excel the world\nat boxing, wrestling, jumping, speed of foot.”\nHe forged ahead and the rest fell in behind.\nThe herald hung the ringing lyre back on its peg\nand taking Demodocus by the hand, led him from the palace,\nguiding him down the same path the island lords\nhad just pursued, keen to watch the contests.\nThey reached the meeting grounds\nwith throngs of people streaming in their trail\nas a press of young champions rose for competition.\n130  Topsail and Riptide rose, the helmsman Rowhard too\nand Seaman and Sternman, Surf-at-the-Beach and Stroke-Oar,\nBreaker and Bowsprit, Racing-the-Wind and Swing-Aboard\nand Seagirt the son of Greatfleet, Shipwrightson\nand the son of Launcher, Broadsea, rose up too,\na match for murderous Ares, death to men —\nin looks and build the best of all Phaeacians\nafter gallant Laodamas, the Captain of the People.\nLaodamas rose with two more sons of great Alcinous,\nHalius bred to the sea and Clytoneus famed for ships.\n140  And now the games began, the first event a footrace . . .\nThey toed the line —\nand broke flat out from the start\nwith a fast pack flying down the field in a whirl of dust\nand Clytoneus the prince outstripped them all by far,\nflashing ahead the length two mules will plow a furrow\nbefore he turned for home, leaving the pack behind\nand raced to reach the crowds.\nNext the wrestling,\ngrueling sport. They grappled, locked, and Broadsea,\npinning the strongest champions, won the bouts.\nNext, in the jumping, Seagirt leapt and beat the field.\n150  In the discus Rowhard up and outhurled them all by far.\nAnd the king’s good son Laodamas boxed them to their knees.\nWhen all had enjoyed the games to their hearts’ content\nAlcinous’ son Laodamas spurred them: “Come, my friends,\nlet’s ask our guest if he knows the ropes of any sport.\nHe’s no mean man, not with a build like that . . .\nLook at his thighs, his legs, and what a pair of arms —\nhis massive neck, his big, rippling strength!\nNor is he past his prime,\njust beaten down by one too many blows.\n160  Nothing worse than the sea, I always say,\nto crush a man, the strongest man alive.”\nAnd Broadsea put in quickly,\n“Well said, Laodamas, right to the point.\nGo up to the fellow, challenge him yourself.”\nOn that cue, the noble prince strode up\nbefore Odysseus, front and center, asking,\n“Come, stranger, sir, won’t you try your hand\nat our contests now? If you have skill in any.\nIt’s fit and proper for you to know your sports.\n170  What greater glory attends a man, while he’s alive,\nthan what he wins with his racing feet and striving hands?\nCome and compete then, throw your cares to the wind!\nIt won’t be long, your journey’s not far off —\nyour ship’s already hauled down to the sea,\nyour crew is set to sail.”\n“Laodamas,”\nquick to the mark Odysseus countered sharply,\n“why do you taunt me so with such a challenge?\nPains weigh on my spirit now, not your sports —\nI’ve suffered much already, struggled hard.\n180  But here I sit amid your assembly still,\nstarved for passage home, begging your king,\nbegging all your people.”\n“Oh I knew it!”\nBroadsea broke in, mocking him to his face.\n“I never took you for someone skilled in games,\nthe kind that real men play throughout the world.\nNot a chance. You’re some skipper of profiteers,\nroving the high seas in his scudding craft,\nreckoning up his freight with a keen eye out\nfor home-cargo, grabbing the gold he can!\nYou’re no athlete. I see that.”\n190                                   With a dark glance\nwily Odysseus shot back, “Indecent talk, my friend.\nYou, you’re a reckless fool —I see that. So,\nthe gods don’t hand out all their gifts at once,\nnot build and brains and flowing speech to all.\nOne man may fail to impress us with his looks\nbut a god can crown his words with beauty, charm,\nand men look on with delight when he speaks out.\nNever faltering, filled with winning self-control,\nhe shines forth at assembly grounds and people gaze\n200  at him like a god when he walks through the streets.\nAnother man may look like a deathless one on high\nbut there’s not a bit of grace to crown his words.\nJust like you, my fine, handsome friend. Not even\na god could improve those lovely looks of yours\nbut the mind inside is worthless.\nYour slander fans the anger in my heart!\nI’m no stranger to sports —for all your taunts —\nI’ve held my place in the front ranks, I tell you,\nlong as I could trust to my youth and striving hands.\n210  But now I’m wrestled down by pain and hardship, look,\nI’ve borne my share of struggles, cleaving my way\nthrough wars of men and pounding waves at sea.\nNevertheless, despite so many blows,\nI’ll compete in your games, just watch. Your insults\ncut to the quick —you rouse my fighting blood!”\nUp he sprang, cloak and all, and seized a discus,\nhuge and heavy, more weighty by far than those\nthe Phaeacians used to hurl and test each other.\nWheeling round, he let loose with his great hand\n220  and the stone whirred on —and down to ground they went,\nthose lords of the long oars and master mariners cringing\nunder the rock’s onrush, soaring lightly out of his grip,\nflying away past all the other marks, and Queen Athena,\nbuilt like a man, staked out the spot and cried\nwith a voice of triumph, “Even a blind man,\nfriend, could find your mark by groping round —\nit’s not mixed up in the crowd, it’s far in front!\nThere’s nothing to fear in this event —\nno one can touch you, much less beat your distance!”\n230     At that the heart of the long-suffering hero laughed,\nso glad to find a ready friend in the crowd that,\nlighter in mood, he challenged all Phaeacia’s best:\n“Now go match that, you young pups, and straightaway\nI’ll hurl you another just as far, I swear, or even farther!\nAll the rest of you, anyone with the spine and spirit,\nstep right up and try me —you’ve incensed me so —\nat boxing, wrestling, racing; nothing daunts me.\nAny Phaeacian here except Laodamas himself.\nThe man’s my host. Who would fight his friend?\n240  He’d have to be good-for-nothing, senseless, yes,\nto challenge his host and come to grips in games,\nin a far-off land at that. He’d cut his own legs short.\nBut there are no others I’d deny or think beneath me —\nI’ll take on all contenders, gladly, test them head-to-head!\nI’m no disgrace in the world of games where men compete.\nWell I know how to handle a fine polished bow,\nthe first to hit my man in a mass of enemies,\neven with rows of comrades pressing near me,\ntaking aim with our shafts to hit our targets.\n250  Philoctetes alone outshot me there at Troy\nwhen ranks of Achaean archers bent their bows.\nOf the rest I’d say that I outclass them all —\nmen still alive, who eat their bread on earth.\nBut I’d never vie with the men of days gone by,\nnot Heracles, not Eurytus of Oechalia —archers\nwho rivaled immortal powers with their bows.\nThat’s why noble Eurytus died a sudden death:\nno old age, creeping upon him in his halls . . .\nApollo shot him down, enraged that the man\nhad challenged him, the Archer God.\n260                                           As for spears,\nI can fling a spear as far as the next man wings an arrow!\nOnly at sprinting I fear you’d leave me in the dust.\nI’ve taken a shameful beating out on heavy seas,\nno conditioning there on shipboard day by day.\nMy legs have lost their spring.”\nHe finished. All stood quiet, hushed.\nOnly Alcinous found a way to answer. “Stranger,\nfriend —nothing you say among us seems ungracious.\nYou simply want to display the gifts you’re born with,\n270  stung that a youngster marched up to you in the games,\nmocking, ridiculing your prowess as no one would\nwho had some sense of fit and proper speech.\nBut come now, hear me out,\nso you can tell our story to other lords\nas you sit and feast in your own halls someday,\nyour own wife and your children by your side,\nremembering there our island prowess here:\nwhat skills great Zeus has given us as well,\ndown all the years from our fathers’ days till now.\n280  We’re hardly world-class boxers or wrestlers, I admit,\nbut we can race like the wind, we’re champion sailors too,\nand always dear to our hearts, the feast, the lyre and dance\nand changes of fresh clothes, our warm baths and beds.\nSo come —all you Phaeacian masters of the dance —\nnow dance away! So our guest can tell his friends,\nwhen he reaches home, how far we excel the world\nin sailing, nimble footwork, dance and song.\nGo, someone,\nquickly, fetch Demodocus now his ringing lyre.\nIt must be hanging somewhere in the palace.”\n290    At the king’s word the herald sprang to his feet\nand ran to fetch the vibrant lyre from the house.\nAnd stewards rose, nine in all, picked from the realm\nto set the stage for contests: masters-at-arms who\nleveled the dancing-floor to make a fine broad ring.\nThe herald returned and placed the ringing lyre now\nin Demodocus’ hands, and the bard moved toward the center,\nflanked by boys in the flush of youth, skilled dancers\nwho stamped the ground with marvelous pulsing steps\nas Odysseus gazed at their flying, flashing feet,\nhis heart aglow with wonder.\n300                                A rippling prelude —\nnow the bard struck up an irresistible song:\nThe Love of Ares and Aphrodite Crowned with Flowers . . .\nhow the two had first made love in Hephaestus’ mansion,\nall in secret. Ares had showered her with gifts\nand showered Hephaestus’ marriage bed with shame\nbut a messenger ran to tell the god of fire —\nHelios, lord of the sun, who’d spied the couple\nlost in each other’s arms and making love.\nHephaestus, hearing the heart-wounding story,\n310  bustled toward his forge, brooding on his revenge —\nplanted the huge anvil on its block and beat out chains,\nnot to be slipped or broken, all to pin the lovers on the spot.\nThis snare the Firegod forged, ablaze with his rage at War,\nthen limped to the room where the bed of love stood firm\nand round the posts he poured the chains in a sweeping net\nwith streams of others flowing down from the roofbeam,\ngossamer-fine as spider webs no man could see,\nnot even a blissful god —\nthe Smith had forged a masterwork of guile.\n320  Once he’d spun that cunning trap around his bed\nhe feigned a trip to the well-built town of Lemnos,\ndearest to him by far of all the towns on earth.\nBut the god of battle kept no blind man’s watch.\nAs soon as he saw the Master Craftsman leave\nhe plied his golden reins and arrived at once\nand entered the famous god of fire’s mansion,\nchafing with lust for Aphrodite crowned with flowers.\nShe’d just returned from her father’s palace, mighty Zeus,\nand now she sat in her rooms as Ares strode right in\n330  and grasped her hand with a warm, seductive urging:\n“Quick, my darling, come, let’s go to bed\nand lose ourselves in love! Your husband’s away —\nby now he must be off in the wilds of Lemnos,\nconsorting with his raucous Sintian friends.”\nSo he pressed\nand her heart raced with joy to sleep with War\nand off they went to bed and down they lay —\nand down around them came those cunning chains\nof the crafty god of fire, showering down now\ntill the couple could not move a limb or lift a finger —\n340  then they knew at last: there was no way out, not now.\nBut now the glorious crippled Smith was drawing near . . .\nhe’d turned around, miles short of the Lemnos coast,\nfor the Sungod kept his watch and told Hephaestus all,\nso back he rushed to his house, his heart consumed with anguish.\nHalting there at the gates, seized with savage rage\nhe howled a terrible cry, imploring all the gods,\n“Father Zeus, look here —\nthe rest of you happy gods who live forever —\nhere is a sight to make you laugh, revolt you too!\n350  Just because I am crippled, Zeus’s daughter Aphrodite\nwill always spurn me and love that devastating Ares,\njust because of his striking looks and racer’s legs\nwhile I am a weakling, lame from birth, and who’s to blame?\nBoth my parents —who else? If only they’d never bred me!\nJust look at the two lovers . . . crawled inside my bed,\nlocked in each other’s arms —the sight makes me burn!\nBut I doubt they’ll want to lie that way much longer,\nnot a moment more —mad as they are for each other.\nNo, they’ll soon tire of bedding down together,\n360  but then my cunning chains will bind them fast\ntill our Father pays my bride-gifts back in full,\nall I handed him for that shameless bitch his daughter,\nirresistible beauty —all unbridled too!”\nSo Hephaestus wailed\nas the gods came crowding up to his bronze-floored house.\nPoseidon god of the earthquake came, and Hermes came,\nthe running god of luck, and the Archer, lord Apollo,\nwhile modesty kept each goddess to her mansion.\nThe immortals, givers of all good things, stood at the gates,\nand uncontrollable laughter burst from the happy gods\n370  when they saw the god of fire’s subtle, cunning work.\nOne would glance at his neighbor, laughing out,\n“A bad day for adultery! Slow outstrips the Swift.”\n“Look how limping Hephaestus conquers War,\nthe quickest of all the gods who rule Olympus!”\n“The cripple wins by craft.”\n“The adulterer,\nhe will pay the price!”\nSo the gods would banter\namong themselves but lord Apollo goaded Hermes on:\n“Tell me, Quicksilver, giver of all good things —\neven with those unwieldy shackles wrapped around you,\n380  how would you like to bed the golden Aphrodite?”\n“Oh Apollo, if only!” the giant-killer cried.\n“Archer, bind me down with triple those endless chains!\nLet all you gods look on, and all you goddesses too —\nhow I’d love to bed that golden Aphrodite!”\nA peal of laughter broke from the deathless ones\nbut not Poseidon, not a smile from him; he kept on\nbegging the famous Smith to loose the god of war,\npleading, his words flying, “Let him go!\nI guarantee you Ares will pay the price,\n390  whatever you ask, Hephaestus,\nwhatever’s right in the eyes of all the gods.”\nBut the famous crippled Smith appealed in turn,\n“God of the earthquake, please don’t urge this on me.\nA pledge for a worthless man is a worthless pledge indeed.\nWhat if he slips out of his chains —his debts as well?\nHow could I shackle you while all the gods look on?”\nBut the god of earthquakes reassured the Smith,\n“Look, Hephaestus, if Ares scuttles off and away,\nsquirming out of his debt, I’ll pay the fine myself.”\n400    And the famous crippled Smith complied at last:\n“Now there’s an offer I really can’t refuse!”\nWith all his force the god of fire loosed the chains\nand the two lovers, free of the bonds that overwhelmed them so,\nsprang up and away at once, and the Wargod sped to Thrace\nwhile Love with her telltale laughter sped to Paphos,\nCyprus Isle, where her grove and scented altar stand.\nThere the Graces bathed and anointed her with oil,\nambrosial oil, the bloom that clings to the gods\nwho never die, and swathed her round in gowns\n410  to stop the heart . . . an ecstasy —a vision.\nThat was the song the famous harper sang\nand Odysseus relished every note as the islanders,\nthe lords of the long oars and master mariners rejoiced.\nNext the king asked Halius and Laodamas to dance,\nthe two alone, since none could match that pair.\nSo taking in hand a gleaming sea-blue ball\nmade by the craftsman Polybus —arching back,\none prince would hurl it toward the shadowy clouds\nas the other leaping high into the air would catch it\n420  quickly, nimbly, before his feet hit ground again.\nOnce they’d vied at throwing the ball straight up,\nthey tossed it back and forth in a blur of hands\nas they danced across the earth that feeds us all,\nwhile boys around the ring stamped out the beat\nand a splendid rhythmic drumming sound arose\nand good Odysseus looked at his host, exclaiming,\n“King Alcinous, shining among your island people,\nyou boasted Phaeacia’s dancers are the best —\nthey prove your point —I watch and I’m amazed!”\n430    His praises cheered the hallowed island king\nwho spoke at once to the master mariners around him:\n“Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia,\nour guest is a man of real taste, I’d say. Come,\nlet’s give him the parting gifts a guest deserves.\nThere are twelve peers of the realm who rule our land,\nthirteen, counting myself. Let each of us contribute\na fresh cloak and shirt and a bar of precious gold.\nGather the gifts together, hurry, so our guest\ncan have them all in hand when he goes to dine,\n440  his spirit filled with joy.\nAs for Broadsea, let him make amends,\nman-to-man, with his words as well as gifts.\nHis first remarks were hardly fit to hear.”\nAll assented and gave their own commands,\neach noble sent a page to fetch his gifts.\nAnd Broadsea volunteered in turn, obliging:\n“Great Alcinous, shining among our island people,\nof course I’ll make amends to our newfound friend\nas you request. I’ll give the man this sword.\n450  It’s solid bronze and the hilt has silver studs,\nthe sheath around it ivory freshly carved.\nHere’s a gift our guest will value highly.”\nHe placed the silver-studded sword in Odysseus’ hands\nwith a burst of warm words: “Farewell, stranger, sir —\nif any remark of mine gave you offense,\nmay stormwinds snatch it up and sweep it off!\nMay the gods grant you safe passage home to see your wife —\nyou’ve been so far from loved ones, suffered so!”\nTactful Odysseus answered him in kind:\n460  “And a warm farewell to you, too, my friend.\nMay the gods grant you good fortune —\nmay you never miss this sword, this gift you give\nwith such salutes. You’ve made amends in full.”\nhe slung the silver-studded sword across his shoulder.\nAs the sun sank, his glittering gifts arrived\nand proud heralds bore them into the hall\nwhere sons of King Alcinous took them over,\nspread them out before their noble mother’s feet —\na grand array of gifts. The king in all his majesty\n470  led the rest of his peers inside, following in a file\nand down they sat on rows of high-backed chairs.\nThe king turned to the queen and urged her, “Come,\nmy dear, bring in an elegant chest, the best you have,\nand lay inside it a fresh cloak and shirt, your own gifts.\nThen heat a bronze cauldron over the fire, boil water,\nso once our guest has bathed and reviewed his gifts —\nall neatly stacked for sailing,\ngifts our Phaeacian lords have brought him now —\nhe’ll feast in peace and hear the harper’s songs.\n480  And I will give him this gorgeous golden cup of mine,\nso he’ll remember Alcinous all his days to come\nwhen he pours libations out in his own house\nto Father Zeus and the other gods on high.”\nAnd at that Arete told her serving-women,\n“Set a great three-legged cauldron over the fire —\ndo it right away!”\nAnd hoisting over the blaze\na cauldron, filling it brimful with bathing water,\nthey piled fresh logs beneath and lit them quickly.\nThe fire lapped at the vessel’s belly, the water warmed.\n490  Meanwhile the queen had a polished chest brought forth\nfrom an inner room and laid the priceless gifts inside,\nthe clothes and gold the Phaeacian lords had brought,\nand added her own gifts, a cloak and a fine shirt,\nand gave her guest instructions quick and clear:\n“Now look to the lid yourself and bind it fast\nwith a good tight knot, so no one can rob you\non your voyage —drifting into a sweet sleep\nas the black ship sails you home.”\nHearing that,\nthe storm-tossed man secured the lid straightway,\n500  he battened it fast with a swift, intricate knot\nthe lady Circe had taught him long ago.\nAnd the housekeeper invited him at once\nto climb into a waiting tub and bathe —\na hot, steaming bath . . .\nwhat a welcome sight to Odysseus’ eyes!\nHe’d been a stranger to comforts such as these\nsince he left the lovely-haired Calypso’s house,\nyet all those years he enjoyed such comforts there,\nnever-ending, as if he were a god . . . And now,\n510  when maids had washed him, rubbed him down with oil\nand drawn warm fleece and a shirt around his shoulders,\nhe stepped from the bath to join the nobles at their wine.\nAnd there stood Nausicaa as he passed. Beside a column\nthat propped the sturdy roof she paused, endowed\nby the gods with all her beauty, gazing at\nOdysseus right before her eyes. Wonderstruck,\nshe hailed her guest with a winning flight of words:\n“Farewell, my friend! And when you are at home,\nhome in your own land, remember me at times.\n520  Mainly to me you owe the gift of life.”\nOdysseus rose to the moment deftly, gently:\n“Nausicaa, daughter of generous King Alcinous,\nmay Zeus the Thunderer, Hera’s husband, grant it so —\nthat I travel home and see the dawn of my return.\nEven at home I’ll pray to you as a deathless goddess\nall my days to come. You saved my life, dear girl.”\nAnd he went and took his seat beside the king.\nBy now they were serving out the portions, mixing wine,\nand the herald soon approached, leading the faithful bard\n530  Demodocus, prized by all the people —seated him in a chair\namid the feasters, leaning it against a central column.\nAt once alert Odysseus carved a strip of loin,\nrich and crisp with fat, from the white-tusked boar\nthat still had much meat left, and called the herald over:\n“Here, herald, take this choice cut to Demodocus\nso he can eat his fill —with warm regards\nfrom a man who knows what suffering is . . .\nFrom all who walk the earth our bards deserve\nesteem and awe, for the Muse herself has taught them\n540  paths of song. She loves the breed of harpers.”\nThe herald placed the gift in Demodocus’ hands\nand the famous blind bard received it, overjoyed.\nThey reached for the good things that lay outspread\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nOdysseus, master of many exploits, praised the singer:\n“I respect you, Demodocus, more than any man alive —\nsurely the Muse has taught you, Zeus’s daughter,\nor god Apollo himself. How true to life,\nall too true . . . you sing the Achaeans’ fate,\n550  all they did and suffered, all they soldiered through,\nas if you were there yourself or heard from one who was.\nBut come now, shift your ground. Sing of the wooden horse\nEpeus built with Athena’s help, the cunning trap that\ngood Odysseus brought one day to the heights of Troy,\nfilled with fighting men who laid the city waste.\nSing that for me —true to life as it deserves —\nand I will tell the world at once how freely\nthe Muse gave you the gods’ own gift of song.”\nStirred now by the Muse, the bard launched out\n560  in a fine blaze of song, starting at just the point\nwhere the main Achaean force, setting their camps afire,\nhad boarded the oarswept ships and sailed for home\nbut famed Odysseus’ men already crouched in hiding —\nin the heart of Troy’s assembly —dark in that horse\nthe Trojans dragged themselves to the city heights.\nNow it stood there, looming . . .\nand round its bulk the Trojans sat debating,\nclashing, days on end. Three plans split their ranks:\neither to hack open the hollow vault with ruthless bronze\n570  or haul it up to the highest ridge and pitch it down the cliffs\nor let it stand —a glorious offering made to pacify the gods —\nand that, that final plan, was bound to win the day.\nFor Troy was fated to perish once the city lodged\ninside her walls the monstrous wooden horse\nwhere the prime of Argive power lay in wait\nwith death and slaughter bearing down on Troy.\nAnd he sang how troops of Achaeans broke from cover,\nstreaming out of the horse’s hollow flanks to plunder Troy —\nhe sang how left and right they ravaged the steep city,\n580  sang how Odysseus marched right up to Deiphobus’ house\nlike the god of war on attack with diehard Menelaus.\nThere, he sang, Odysseus fought the grimmest fight\nhe had ever braved but he won through at last,\nthanks to Athena’s superhuman power.\nThat was the song the famous harper sang\nbut great Odysseus melted into tears,\nrunning down from his eyes to wet his cheeks . . .\nas a woman weeps, her arms flung round her darling husband,\na man who fell in battle, fighting for town and townsmen,\n590  trying to beat the day of doom from home and children.\nSeeing the man go down, dying, gasping for breath,\nshe clings for dear life, screams and shrills —\nbut the victors, just behind her,\ndigging spear-butts into her back and shoulders,\ndrag her off in bondage, yoked to hard labor, pain,\nand the most heartbreaking torment wastes her cheeks.\nSo from Odysseus’ eyes ran tears of heartbreak now.\nBut his weeping went unmarked by all the others;\nonly Alcinous, sitting close beside him,\n600  noticed his guest’s tears,\nheard the groan in the man’s labored breathing\nand said at once to the master mariners around him,\n“Hear me, my lords and captains of Phaeacia!\nLet Demodocus rest his ringing lyre now —\nthis song he sings can hardly please us all.\nEver since our meal began and the stirring bard\nlaunched his song, our guest has never paused\nin his tears and throbbing sorrow.\nClearly grief has overpowered his heart.\nBreak off this song! Let us all enjoy ourselves,\nthe hosts and guest together. Much the warmer way.\nAll these things are performed for him, our honored guest,\nthe royal send-off here and gifts we give in love.\nTreat your guest and suppliant like a brother:\nanyone with a touch of sense knows that.\nSo don’t be crafty now, my friend, don’t hide\nthe truth I’m after. Fair is fair, speak out!\nCome, tell us the name they call you there at home —\nyour mother, father, townsmen, neighbors round about.\n620  Surely no man in the world is nameless, all told.\nBorn high, born low, as soon as he sees the light\nhis parents always name him, once he’s born.\nAnd tell me your land, your people, your city too,\nso our ships can sail you home —their wits will speed them there.\nFor we have no steersmen here among Phaeacia’s crews\nor steering-oars that guide your common craft.\nOur ships know in a flash their mates’ intentions,\nknow all ports of call and all the rich green fields.\nWith wings of the wind they cross the sea’s huge gulfs,\n630  shrouded in mist and cloud —no fear in the world of foundering,\nfatal shipwreck.\nTrue, there’s an old tale I heard\nmy father telling once. Nausithous used to say\nthat lord Poseidon was vexed with us because\nwe escorted all mankind and never came to grief.\nHe said that one day, as a well-built ship of ours\nsailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy,\nthe god would crush it, yes,\nand pile a huge mountain round about our port.\nSo the old king foretold . . . And as for the god, well,\n640  he can do his worst or leave it quite undone,\nwhatever warms his heart.\nBut come, my friend,\ntell us your own story now, and tell it truly.\nWhere have your rovings forced you?\nWhat lands of men have you seen, what sturdy towns,\nwhat men themselves? Who were wild, savage, lawless?\nWho were friendly to strangers, god-fearing men? Tell me,\nwhy do you weep and grieve so sorely when you hear\nthe fate of the Argives, hear the fall of Troy?\nThat is the gods’ work, spinning threads of death\n650  through the lives of mortal men,\nand all to make a song for those to come . . .\nDid one of your kinsmen die before the walls of Troy,\nsome brave man —a son by marriage? father by marriage?\nNext to our own blood kin, our nearest, dearest ties.\nOr a friend perhaps, someone close to your heart,\nstaunch and loyal? No less dear than a brother,\nthe brother-in-arms who shares our inmost thoughts.”"

    "text": "Odysseus, the great teller of tales, launched out on his story:\n“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,\nwhat a fine thing it is to listen to such a bard\nas we have here —the man sings like a god.\nThe crown of life, I’d say. There’s nothing better\nthan when deep joy holds sway throughout the realm\nand banqueters up and down the palace sit in ranks,\nenthralled to hear the bard, and before them all, the tables\nheaped with bread and meats, and drawing wine from a mixing-bowl\n10  the steward makes his rounds and keeps the winecups flowing.\nThis, to my mind, is the best that life can offer.\nyou’re set on probing the bitter pains I’ve borne,\nso I’m to weep and grieve, it seems, still more.\nWell then, what shall I go through first,\nwhat shall I save for last?\nWhat pains —the gods have given me my share.\nNow let me begin by telling you my name . . .\nso you may know it well and I in times to come,\nif I can escape the fatal day, will be your host,\n20  your sworn friend, though my home is far from here.\nI am Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to the world\nfor every kind of craft —my fame has reached the skies.\nSunny Ithaca is my home. Atop her stands our seamark,\nMount Neriton’s leafy ridges shimmering in the wind.\nAround her a ring of islands circle side-by-side,\nDulichion, Same, wooded Zacynthus too, but mine\nlies low and away, the farthest out to sea,\nrearing into the western dusk\nwhile the others face the east and breaking day.\n30  Mine is a rugged land but good for raising sons —\nand I myself, I know no sweeter sight on earth\nthan a man’s own native country.\nTrue enough,\nCalypso the lustrous goddess tried to hold me back,\ndeep in her arching caverns, craving me for a husband.\nSo did Circe, holding me just as warmly in her halls,\nthe bewitching queen of Aeaea keen to have me too.\nBut they never won the heart inside me, never.\nSo nothing is as sweet as a man’s own country,\nhis own parents, even though he’s settled down\n40  in some luxurious house, off in a foreign land\nand far from those who bore him.\nNo more. Come,\nlet me tell you about the voyage fraught with hardship\nZeus inflicted on me, homeward bound from Troy . . .\nThe wind drove me out of Ilium on to Ismarus,\nthe Cicones’ stronghold. There I sacked the city,\nkilled the men, but as for the wives and plunder,\nthat rich haul we dragged away from the place —\nwe shared it round so no one, not on my account,\nwould go deprived of his fair share of spoils.\n50  Then I urged them to cut and run, set sail,\nbut would they listen? Not those mutinous fools;\nthere was too much wine to swill, too many sheep to slaughter\ndown along the beach, and shambling longhorn cattle.\nAnd all the while the Cicones sought out other Cicones,\ncalled for help from their neighbors living inland:\na larger force, and stronger soldiers too,\nskilled hands at fighting men from chariots,\nskilled, when a crisis broke, to fight on foot.\nOut of the morning mist they came against us —\n60  packed as the leaves and spears that flower forth in spring —\nand Zeus presented us with disaster, me and my comrades\ndoomed to suffer blow on mortal blow. Lining up,\nboth armies battled it out against our swift ships,\nboth raked each other with hurtling bronze lances.\nLong as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger\nwe stood and fought them off, massed as they were, but then,\nwhen the sun wheeled past the hour for unyoking oxen,\nthe Cicones broke our lines and beat us down at last.\nOut of each ship, six men-at-arms were killed;\n70  the rest of us rowed away from certain doom.\nFrom there we sailed on, glad to escape our death\nyet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost.\nBut I would not let our rolling ships set sail until the crews\nhad raised the triple cry, saluting each poor comrade\ncut down by the fierce Cicones on that plain.\nNow Zeus who masses the stormclouds hit the fleet\nwith the North Wind —\na howling, demonic gale, shrouding over\nin thunderheads the earth and sea at once —\nand night swept down\nfrom the sky and the ships went plunging headlong on,\n80  our sails slashed to rags by the hurricane’s blast!\nWe struck them —cringing at death we rowed our ships\nto the nearest shoreline, pulled with all our power.\nThere, for two nights, two days, we lay by, no letup,\neating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired.\nWhen Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day,\nthen stepping the masts and hoisting white sails high,\nwe lounged at the oarlocks, letting wind and helmsmen\nkeep us true on course . . .\nAnd now, at long last,\nI might have reached my native land unscathed,\nbut just as I doubled Malea’s cape, a tide-rip\n90  and the North Wind drove me way off course\ncareering past Cythera.\nNine whole days\nI was borne along by rough, deadly winds\non the fish-infested sea. Then on the tenth\nour squadron reached the land of the Lotus-eaters,\npeople who eat the lotus, mellow fruit and flower.\nWe disembarked on the coast, drew water there\nand crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships.\nOnce we’d had our fill of food and drink I sent\n100  a detail ahead, two picked men and a third, a runner,\nto scout out who might live there —men like us perhaps,\nwho live on bread? So off they went and soon enough\nthey mingled among the natives, Lotus-eaters, Lotus-eaters\nwho had no notion of killing my companions, not at all,\nthey simply gave them the lotus to taste instead . . .\nAny crewmen who ate the lotus, the honey-sweet fruit,\nlost all desire to send a message back, much less return,\ntheir only wish to linger there with the Lotus-eaters,\ngrazing on lotus, all memory of the journey home\n110  dissolved forever. But I brought them back, back\nto the hollow ships, and streaming tears —I forced them,\nhauled them under the rowing benches, lashed them fast\nand shouted out commands to my other, steady comrades:\n‘Quick, no time to lose, embark in the racing ships!’ —\nso none could eat the lotus, forget the voyage home.\nThey swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks\nand in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.\nFrom there we sailed on, our spirits now at a low ebb,\nand reached the land of the high and mighty Cyclops,\n120  lawless brutes, who trust so to the everlasting gods\nthey never plant with their own hands or plow the soil.\nUnsown, unplowed, the earth teems with all they need,\nwheat, barley and vines, swelled by the rains of Zeus\nto yield a big full-bodied wine from clustered grapes.\nThey have no meeting place for council, no laws either,\nno, up on the mountain peaks they live in arching caverns —\neach a law to himself, ruling his wives and children,\nnot a care in the world for any neighbor.\na level island stretches flat across the harbor,\n130  not close inshore to the Cyclops’ coast, not too far out,\nthick with woods where the wild goats breed by hundreds.\nNo trampling of men to start them from their lairs,\nno hunters roughing it out on the woody ridges,\nstalking quarry, ever raid their haven.\nNo flocks browse, no plowlands roll with wheat;\nunplowed, unsown forever —empty of humankind —\nthe island just feeds droves of bleating goats.\nFor the Cyclops have no ships with crimson prows,\nno shipwrights there to build them good trim craft\n140  that could sail them out to foreign ports of call\nas most men risk the seas to trade with other men.\nSuch artisans would have made this island too\na decent place to live in . . . No mean spot,\nit could bear you any crop you like in season.\nThe water-meadows along the low foaming shore\nrun soft and moist, and your vines would never flag.\nThe land’s clear for plowing. Harvest on harvest,\na man could reap a healthy stand of grain —\nthe subsoil’s dark and rich.\n150  There’s a snug deep-water harbor there, what’s more,\nno need for mooring-gear, no anchor-stones to heave,\nno cables to make fast. Just beach your keels, ride out\nthe days till your shipmates’ spirit stirs for open sea\nand a fair wind blows. And last, at the harbor’s head\nthere’s a spring that rushes fresh from beneath a cave\nand black poplars flourish round its mouth.\nhere we landed, and surely a god steered us in\nthrough the pitch-black night.\nNot that he ever showed himself, with thick fog\n160  swirling around the ships, the moon wrapped in clouds\nand not a glimmer stealing through that gloom.\nNot one of us glimpsed the island —scanning hard —\nor the long combers rolling us slowly toward the coast,\nnot till our ships had run their keels ashore.\nBeaching our vessels smoothly, striking sail,\nthe crews swung out on the low shelving sand\nand there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn’s first light.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nwe all turned out, intrigued to tour the island.\n170  The local nymphs, the daughters of Zeus himself,\nflushed mountain-goats so the crews could make their meal.\nQuickly we fetched our curved bows and hunting spears\nfrom the ships and, splitting up into three bands,\nwe started shooting, and soon enough some god\nhad sent us bags of game to warm our hearts.\nA dozen vessels sailed in my command\nand to each crew nine goats were shared out\nand mine alone took ten. Then all day long\ntill the sun went down we sat and feasted well\n180  on sides of meat and rounds of heady wine.\nThe good red stock in our vessels’ holds\nhad not run out, there was still plenty left;\nthe men had carried off a generous store in jars\nwhen we stormed and sacked the Cicones’ holy city.\nNow we stared across at the Cyclops’ shore, so near\nwe could even see their smoke, hear their voices,\ntheir bleating sheep and goats . . .\nAnd then when the sun had set and night came on\nwe lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge.\n190  When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nI called a muster briskly, commanding all the hands,\n‘The rest of you stay here, my friends-in-arms.\nI’ll go across with my own ship and crew\nand probe the natives living over there.\nWhat are they —violent, savage, lawless?\nor friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?’\nWith that I boarded ship and told the crew\nto embark at once and cast off cables quickly.\nThey swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks\n200  and in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.\nBut as soon as we reached the coast I mentioned —no long trip —\nwe spied a cavern just at the shore, gaping above the surf,\ntowering, overgrown with laurel. And here big flocks,\nsheep and goats, were stalled to spend the nights,\nand around its mouth a yard was walled up\nwith quarried boulders sunk deep in the earth\nand enormous pines and oak-trees looming darkly . . .\nHere was a giant’s lair, in fact, who always pastured\nhis sheepflocks far afield and never mixed with others.\n210  A grim loner, dead set in his own lawless ways.\nHere was a piece of work, by god, a monster\nbuilt like no mortal who ever supped on bread,\nno, like a shaggy peak, I’d say —a man-mountain\nrearing head and shoulders over the world.\nI told most of my good trusty crew to wait,\nto sit tight by the ship and guard her well\nwhile I picked out my dozen finest fighters\nand off I went. But I took a skin of wine along,\nthe ruddy, irresistible wine that Maron gave me once,\nEuanthes’ son, a priest of Apollo, lord of Ismarus,\nbecause we’d rescued him, his wife and children,\nreverent as we were;\nhe lived, you see, in Apollo’s holy grove.\nAnd so in return he gave me splendid gifts,\nhe handed me seven bars of well-wrought gold,\na mixing-bowl of solid silver, then this wine . . .\nHe drew it off in generous wine-jars, twelve in all,\nall unmixed —and such a bouquet, a drink fit for the gods!\nNo maid or man of his household knew that secret store,\n230  only himself, his loving wife and a single servant.\nWhenever they’d drink the deep-red mellow vintage,\ntwenty cups of water he’d stir in one of wine\nand what an aroma wafted from the bowl —\nwhat magic, what a godsend —\nno joy in holding back when that was poured!\nFilling a great goatskin now, I took this wine,\nprovisions too in a leather sack. A sudden foreboding\ntold my fighting spirit I’d soon come up against\nsome giant clad in power like armor-plate —\n240  a savage deaf to justice, blind to law.\nOur party quickly made its way to his cave\nbut we failed to find our host himself inside;\nhe was off in his pasture, ranging his sleek flocks.\nSo we explored his den, gazing wide-eyed at it all,\nthe large flat racks loaded with drying cheeses,\nthe folds crowded with young lambs and kids,\nsplit into three groups —here the spring-born,\nhere mid-yearlings, here the fresh sucklings\noff to the side —each sort was penned apart.\n250  And all his vessels, pails and hammered buckets\nhe used for milking, were brimming full with whey.\nFrom the start my comrades pressed me, pleading hard,\n‘Let’s make away with the cheeses, then come back —\nhurry, drive the lambs and kids from the pens\nto our swift ship, put out to sea at once!’\nBut I would not give way —\nand how much better it would have been —\nnot till I saw him, saw what gifts he’d give.\nBut he proved no lovely sight to my companions.\n260    There we built a fire, set our hands on the cheeses,\noffered some to the gods and ate the bulk ourselves\nand settled down inside, awaiting his return . . .\nAnd back he came from pasture, late in the day,\nherding his flocks home, and lugging a huge load\nof good dry logs to fuel his fire at supper.\nHe flung them down in the cave —a jolting crash —\nwe scuttled in panic into the deepest dark recess.\nAnd next he drove his sleek flocks into the open vault,\nall he’d milk at least, but he left the males outside,\n270  rams and billy goats out in the high-walled yard.\nThen to close his door he hoisted overhead\na tremendous, massive slab —\nno twenty-two wagons, rugged and four-wheeled,\ncould budge that boulder off the ground, I tell you,\nsuch an immense stone the monster wedged to block his cave!\nThen down he squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats,\neach in order, and put a suckling underneath each dam.\nAnd half of the fresh white milk he curdled quickly,\nset it aside in wicker racks to press for cheese,\n280  the other half let stand in pails and buckets,\nready at hand to wash his supper down.\nAs soon as he’d briskly finished all his chores\nhe lit his fire and spied us in the blaze and\n‘Strangers!’ he thundered out, ‘now who are you?\nWhere did you sail from, over the running sea-lanes?\nOut on a trading spree or roving the waves like pirates,\nsea-wolves raiding at will, who risk their lives\nto plunder other men?’\nThe hearts inside us shook,\nterrified by his rumbling voice and monstrous hulk.\n290  Nevertheless I found the nerve to answer, firmly,\n‘Men of Achaea we are and bound now from Troy!\nDriven far off course by the warring winds,\nover the vast gulf of the sea —battling home\non a strange tack, a route that’s off the map,\nand so we’ve come to you . . .\nso it must please King Zeus’s plotting heart.\nWe’re glad to say we’re men of Atrides Agamemnon,\nwhose fame is the proudest thing on earth these days,\nso great a city he sacked, such multitudes he killed!\n300  But since we’ve chanced on you, we’re at your knees\nin hopes of a warm welcome, even a guest-gift,\nthe sort that hosts give strangers. That’s the custom.\nRespect the gods, my friend. We’re suppliants —at your mercy!\nZeus of the Strangers guards all guests and suppliants:\nstrangers are sacred —Zeus will avenge their rights!’\n‘Stranger,’ he grumbled back from his brutal heart,\n‘you must be a fool, stranger, or come from nowhere,\ntelling me to fear the gods or avoid their wrath!\nWe Cyclops never blink at Zeus and Zeus’s shield\n310  of storm and thunder, or any other blessed god —\nwe’ve got more force by far.\nI’d never spare you in fear of Zeus’s hatred,\nyou or your comrades here, unless I had the urge.\nBut tell me, where did you moor your sturdy ship\nwhen you arrived? Up the coast or close in?\nI’d just like to know.’\nSo he laid his trap\nbut he never caught me, no, wise to the world\nI shot back in my crafty way, ‘My ship?\nPoseidon god of the earthquake smashed my ship,\n320  he drove it against the rocks at your island’s far cape,\nhe dashed it against a cliff as the winds rode us in.\nI and the men you see escaped a sudden death.’\nNot a word in reply to that, the ruthless brute.\nLurching up, he lunged out with his hands toward my men\nand snatching two at once, rapping them on the ground\nhe knocked them dead like pups —\ntheir brains gushed out all over, soaked the floor —\nand ripping them limb from limb to fix his meal\nhe bolted them down like a mountain-lion, left no scrap,\n330  devoured entrails, flesh and bones, marrow and all!\nWe flung our arms to Zeus, we wept and cried aloud,\nlooking on at his grisly work —paralyzed, appalled.\nBut once the Cyclops had stuffed his enormous gut\nwith human flesh, washing it down with raw milk,\nhe slept in his cave, stretched out along his flocks.\nAnd I with my fighting heart, I thought at first\nto steal up to him, draw the sharp sword at my hip\nand stab his chest where the midriff packs the liver —\nI groped for the fatal spot but a fresh thought held me back.\n340  There at a stroke we’d finish off ourselves as well —\nhow could we with our bare hands heave back\nthat slab he set to block his cavern’s gaping maw?\nSo we lay there groaning, waiting Dawn’s first light.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthe monster relit his fire and milked his handsome ewes,\neach in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam,\nand as soon as he’d briskly finished all his chores\nhe snatched up two more men and fixed his meal.\nWell-fed, he drove his fat sheep from the cave,\n350  lightly lifting the huge doorslab up and away,\nthen slipped it back in place\nas a hunter flips the lid of his quiver shut.\nPiercing whistles —turning his flocks to the hills\nhe left me there, the heart inside me brooding on revenge:\nhow could I pay him back? would Athena give me glory?\nHere was the plan that struck my mind as best . . .\nthe Cyclops’ great club: there it lay by the pens,\nolivewood, full of sap. He’d lopped it off to brandish\nonce it dried. Looking it over, we judged it big enough\n360  to be the mast of a pitch-black ship with her twenty oars,\na freighter broad in the beam that plows through miles of sea —\nso long, so thick it bulked before our eyes. Well,\nflanking it now, I chopped off a fathom’s length,\nrolled it to comrades, told them to plane it down,\nand they made the club smooth as I bent and shaved\nthe tip to a stabbing point. I turned it over\nthe blazing fire to char it good and hard,\nthen hid it well, buried deep under the dung\nthat littered the cavern’s floor in thick wet clumps.\n370  And now I ordered my shipmates all to cast lots —\nwho’d brave it out with me\nto hoist our stake and grind it into his eye\nwhen sleep had overcome him? Luck of the draw:\nI got the very ones I would have picked myself,\nfour good men, and I in the lead made five . . .\nNightfall brought him back, herding his woolly sheep\nand he quickly drove the sleek flock into the vaulted cavern,\nrams and all —none left outside in the walled yard —\nhis own idea, perhaps, or a god led him on.\n380  Then he hoisted the huge slab to block the door\nand squatted to milk his sheep and bleating goats,\neach in order, putting a suckling underneath each dam,\nand as soon as he’d briskly finished all his chores\nhe snatched up two more men and fixed his meal.\nBut this time I lifted a carved wooden bowl,\nbrimful of my ruddy wine,\nand went right up to the Cyclops, enticing,\n‘Here, Cyclops, try this wine —to top off\nthe banquet of human flesh you’ve bolted down!\n390  Judge for yourself what stock our ship had stored.\nI brought it here to make you a fine libation,\nhoping you would pity me, Cyclops, send me home,\nbut your rages are insufferable. You barbarian —\nhow can any man on earth come visit you after this?\nWhat you’ve done outrages all that’s right!’\nAt that he seized the bowl and tossed it off\nand the heady wine pleased him immensely —‘More’ —\nhe demanded a second bowl —‘a hearty helping!\nAnd tell me your name now, quickly,\n400  so I can hand my guest a gift to warm his heart.\nOur soil yields the Cyclops powerful, full-bodied wine\nand the rains from Zeus build its strength. But this,\nthis is nectar, ambrosia —this flows from heaven!’\nSo he declared. I poured him another fiery bowl —\nthree bowls I brimmed and three he drank to the last drop,\nthe fool, and then, when the wine was swirling round his brain,\nI approached my host with a cordial, winning word:\n‘So, you ask me the name I’m known by, Cyclops?\nI will tell you. But you must give me a guest-gift\nas you’ve promised. Nobody —that’s my name. Nobody —\nso my mother and father call me, all my friends.’\nBut he boomed back at me from his ruthless heart,\n‘Nobody? I’ll eat Nobody last of all his friends —\nI’ll eat the others first! That’s my gift to you!’\nhe toppled over, sprawled full-length, flat on his back\nand lay there, his massive neck slumping to one side,\nand sleep that conquers all overwhelmed him now\nas wine came spurting, flooding up from his gullet\nwith chunks of human flesh —he vomited, blind drunk.\n420  Now, at last, I thrust our stake in a bed of embers\nto get it red-hot and rallied all my comrades:\n‘Courage —no panic, no one hang back now!’\nAnd green as it was, just as the olive stake\nwas about to catch fire —the glow terrific, yes —\nI dragged it from the flames, my men clustering round\nas some god breathed enormous courage through us all.\nHoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point,\nstraight into the monster’s eye they rammed it hard —\nI drove my weight on it from above and bored it home\n430  as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright’s drill\nthat men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl\nand the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping —\nSo we seized our stake with its fiery tip\nand bored it round and round in the giant’s eye\ntill blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft\nand the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core\nand the broiling eyeball burst —\nits crackling roots blazed\nand hissed —\nas a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze\nin an ice-cold bath and the metal screeches steam\n440  and its temper hardens —that’s the iron’s strength —\nso the eye of the Cyclops sizzled round that stake!\nHe loosed a hideous roar, the rock walls echoed round\nand we scuttled back in terror. The monster wrenched the spike\nfrom his eye and out it came with a red geyser of blood —\nhe flung it aside with frantic hands, and mad with pain\nhe bellowed out for help from his neighbor Cyclops\nliving round about in caves on windswept crags.\nHearing his cries, they lumbered up from every side\nand hulking round his cavern, asked what ailed him:\n450  ‘What, Polyphemus, what in the world’s the trouble?\nRoaring out in the godsent night to rob us of our sleep.\nSurely no one’s rustling your flocks against your will —\nsurely no one’s trying to kill you now by fraud or force!’\n‘Nobody, friends’ —Polyphemus bellowed back from his cave —\n‘Nobody’s killing me now by fraud and not by force!’\n‘If you’re alone,’ his friends boomed back at once,\n‘and nobody’s trying to overpower you now —look,\nit must be a plague sent here by mighty Zeus\nand there’s no escape from that.\n460  You’d better pray to your father, Lord Poseidon.’\nThey lumbered off, but laughter filled my heart\nto think how nobody’s name —my great cunning stroke —\nhad duped them one and all. But the Cyclops there,\nstill groaning, racked with agony, groped around\nfor the huge slab, and heaving it from the doorway,\ndown he sat in the cave’s mouth, his arms spread wide,\nhoping to catch a comrade stealing out with sheep —\nsuch a blithering fool he took me for!\nBut I was already plotting . . .\n470  what was the best way out? how could I find\nescape from death for my crew, myself as well?\nMy wits kept weaving, weaving cunning schemes —\nlife at stake, monstrous death staring us in the face —\ntill this plan struck my mind as best. That flock,\nthose well-fed rams with their splendid thick fleece,\nsturdy, handsome beasts sporting their dark weight of wool:\nI lashed them abreast, quietly, twisting the willow-twigs\nthe Cyclops slept on —giant, lawless brute —I took them\nthree by three; each ram in the middle bore a man\n480  while the two rams either side would shield him well.\nSo three beasts to bear each man, but as for myself?\nThere was one bellwether ram, the prize of all the flock,\nand clutching him by his back, tucked up under\nhis shaggy belly, there I hung, face upward,\nboth hands locked in his marvelous deep fleece,\nclinging for dear life, my spirit steeled, enduring . . .\nSo we held on, desperate, waiting Dawn’s first light.\nas young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthe rams went rumbling out of the cave toward pasture,\n490  the ewes kept bleating round the pens, unmilked,\ntheir udders about to burst. Their master now,\nheaving in torment, felt the back of each animal\nhalting before him here, but the idiot never sensed\nmy men were trussed up under their thick fleecy ribs.\nAnd last of them all came my great ram now, striding out,\nweighed down with his dense wool and my deep plots.\nStroking him gently, powerful Polyphemus murmured,\n‘Dear old ram, why last of the flock to quit the cave?\nIn the good old days you’d never lag behind the rest —\n500  you with your long marching strides, first by far\nof the flock to graze the fresh young grasses,\nfirst by far to reach the rippling streams,\nfirst to turn back home, keen for your fold\nwhen night comes on —but now you’re last of all.\nAnd why? Sick at heart for your master’s eye\nthat coward gouged out with his wicked crew? —\nonly after he’d stunned my wits with wine —\nthat, that Nobody . . .\nwho’s not escaped his death, I swear, not yet.\n510  Oh if only you thought like me, had words like me\nto tell me where that scoundrel is cringing from my rage!\nI’d smash him against the ground, I’d spill his brains —\nflooding across my cave —and that would ease my heart\nof the pains that good-for-nothing Nobody made me suffer!’\nAnd with that threat he let my ram go free outside.\nBut soon as we’d got one foot past cave and courtyard,\nfirst I loosed myself from the ram, then loosed my men,\nthen quickly, glancing back again and again we drove\nour flock, good plump beasts with their long shanks,\n520  straight to the ship, and a welcome sight we were\nto loyal comrades —we who’d escaped our deaths —\nbut for all the rest they broke down and wailed.\nI cut it short, I stopped each shipmate’s cries,\nmy head tossing, brows frowning, silent signals\nto hurry, tumble our fleecy herd on board,\nlaunch out on the open sea!\nThey swung aboard, they sat to the oars in ranks\nand in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.\nBut once offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry,\n530  I called back to the Cyclops, stinging taunts:\n‘So, Cyclops, no weak coward it was whose crew\nyou bent to devour there in your vaulted cave —\nyou with your brute force! Your filthy crimes\ncame down on your own head, you shameless cannibal,\ndaring to eat your guests in your own house —\nso Zeus and the other gods have paid you back!’\nThat made the rage of the monster boil over.\nRipping off the peak of a towering crag, he heaved it\nso hard the boulder landed just in front of our dark prow\n540  and a huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under —\na tidal wave from the open sea. The sudden backwash\ndrove us landward again, forcing us close inshore\nbut grabbing a long pole, I thrust us off and away,\ntossing my head for dear life, signaling crews\nto put their backs in the oars, escape grim death.\nThey threw themselves in the labor, rowed on fast\nbut once we’d plowed the breakers twice as far,\nagain I began to taunt the Cyclops —men around me\ntrying to check me, calm me, left and right:\n550  ‘So headstrong —why? Why rile the beast again?’\n‘That rock he flung in the sea just now, hurling our ship\nto shore once more —we thought we’d die on the spot!’\n‘If he’d caught a sound from one of us, just a moan,\nhe would have crushed our heads and ship timbers\nwith one heave of another flashing, jagged rock!’\n‘Good god, the brute can throw!’\nSo they begged\nbut they could not bring my fighting spirit round.\nI called back with another burst of anger, ‘Cyclops —\nif any man on the face of the earth should ask you\nwho blinded you, shamed you so —say Odysseus,\nraider of cities, he gouged out your eye,\nLaertes’ son who makes his home in Ithaca!’\nSo I vaunted and he groaned back in answer,\n‘Oh no, no —that prophecy years ago . . .\nit all comes home to me with a vengeance now!\nWe once had a prophet here, a great tall man,\nTelemus, Eurymus’ son, a master at reading signs,\nwho grew old in his trade among his fellow-Cyclops.\nAll this, he warned me, would come to pass someday —\n570  that I’d be blinded here at the hands of one Odysseus.\nBut I always looked for a handsome giant man to cross my path,\nsome fighter clad in power like armor-plate, but now,\nlook what a dwarf, a spineless good-for-nothing,\nstuns me with wine, then gouges out my eye!\nCome here, Odysseus, let me give you a guest-gift\nand urge Poseidon the earthquake god to speed you home.\nI am his son and he claims to be my father, true,\nand he himself will heal me if he pleases —\nno other blessed god, no man can do the work!’\n‘Heal you!’ —\n580  here was my parting shot —‘Would to god I could strip you\nof life and breath and ship you down to the House of Death\nas surely as no one will ever heal your eye,\nnot even your earthquake god himself!’\nBut at that he bellowed out to lord Poseidon,\nthrusting his arms to the starry skies, and prayed, ‘Hear me —\nPoseidon, god of the sea-blue mane who rocks the earth!\nIf I really am your son and you claim to be my father —\ncome, grant that Odysseus, raider of cities,\nLaertes’ son who makes his home in Ithaca,\nnever reaches home. Or if he’s fated to see\nhis people once again and reach his well-built house\nand his own native country, let him come home late\nand come a broken man —all shipmates lost,\nalone in a stranger’s ship —\nand let him find a world of pain at home!’\nSo he prayed\nand the god of the sea-blue mane, Poseidon, heard his prayer.\nThe monster suddenly hoisted a boulder —far larger —\nwheeled and heaved it, putting his weight behind it,\nmassive strength, and the boulder crashed close,\n600  landing just in the wake of our dark stern,\njust failing to graze the rudder’s bladed edge.\nA huge swell reared up as the rock went plunging under,\nyes, and the tidal breaker drove us out to our island’s\nfar shore where all my well-decked ships lay moored,\nclustered, waiting, and huddled round them, crewmen\nsat in anguish, waiting, chafing for our return.\nWe beached our vessel hard ashore on the sand,\nwe swung out in the frothing surf ourselves,\nand herding Cyclops’ sheep from our deep holds\n610  we shared them round so no one, not on my account,\nwould go deprived of his fair share of spoils.\nBut the splendid ram —as we meted out the flocks\nmy friends-in-arms made him my prize of honor,\nmine alone, and I slaughtered him on the beach\nand burnt his thighs to Cronus’ mighty son,\nZeus of the thundercloud who rules the world.\nBut my sacrifices failed to move the god:\nZeus was still obsessed with plans to destroy\nmy entire oarswept fleet and loyal crew of comrades.\n620  Now all day long till the sun went down we sat\nand feasted on sides of meat and heady wine.\nThen when the sun had set and night came on\nwe lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nI roused the men straightway, ordering all crews\nto man the ships and cast off cables quickly.\nThey swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks\nand in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.\nAnd from there we sailed on, glad to escape our death\n630  yet sick at heart for the comrades we had lost.”"

    "text": "“We reached the Aeolian island next, the home of Aeolus,\nHippotas’ son, beloved by the gods who never die —\na great floating island it was, and round it all\nhuge ramparts rise of indestructible bronze\nand sheer rock cliffs shoot up from sea to sky.\nThe king had sired twelve children within his halls,\nsix daughters and six sons in the lusty prime of youth,\nso he gave his daughters as wives to his six sons.\nSeated beside their dear father and doting mother,\n10  with delicacies aplenty spread before them,\nthey feast on forever . . . All day long\nthe halls breathe the savor of roasted meats\nand echo round to the low moan of blowing pipes,\nand all night long, each one by his faithful mate,\nthey sleep under soft-piled rugs on corded bedsteads.\nTo this city of theirs we came, their splendid palace,\nand Aeolus hosted me one entire month, he pressed me for news\nof Troy and the Argive ships and how we sailed for home,\nand I told him the whole long story, first to last.\n20  And then, when I begged him to send me on my way,\nhe denied me nothing, he went about my passage.\nHe gave me a sack, the skin of a full-grown ox,\nbinding inside the winds that howl from every quarter,\nfor Zeus had made that king the master of all the winds,\nwith power to calm them down or rouse them as he pleased.\nAeolus stowed the sack inside my holds, lashed so fast\nwith a burnished silver cord\nnot even a slight puff could slip past that knot.\nYet he set the West Wind free to blow us on our way\n30  and waft our squadron home. But his plan was bound to fail,\nyes, our own reckless folly swept us on to ruin . . .\nNine whole days we sailed, nine nights, nonstop.\nOn the tenth our own land hove into sight at last —\nwe were so close we could see men tending fires.\nBut now an enticing sleep came on me, bone-weary\nfrom working the vessel’s sheet myself, no letup,\nnever trusting the ropes to any other mate,\nthe faster to journey back to native land.\nBut the crews began to mutter among themselves,\n40  sure I was hauling troves of gold and silver home,\nthe gifts of open-hearted Aeolus, Hippotas’ son.\n‘The old story!’ One man glanced at another, grumbling.\n‘Look at our captain’s luck —so loved by the world,\nso prized at every landfall, every port of call.’\n‘Heaps of lovely plunder he hauls home from Troy,\nwhile we who went through slogging just as hard,\nwe go home empty-handed.’\n‘Now this Aeolus loads him\ndown with treasure. Favoritism, friend to friend!’\n‘Hurry, let’s see what loot is in that sack,\n50  how much gold and silver. Break it open —now!’\nA fatal plan, but it won my shipmates over.\nThey loosed the sack and all the winds burst out\nand a sudden squall struck and swept us back to sea,\nwailing, in tears, far from our own native land.\nAnd I woke up with a start, my spirit churning —\nshould I leap over the side and drown at once or\ngrit my teeth and bear it, stay among the living?\nI bore it all, held firm, hiding my face,\nclinging tight to the decks\n60  while heavy squalls blasted our squadron back\nagain to Aeolus’ island, shipmates groaning hard.\nWe disembarked on the coast, drew water there\nand crewmen snatched a meal by the swift ships.\nOnce we’d had our fill of food and drink\nI took a shipmate along with me, a herald too,\nand approached King Aeolus’ famous halls and here\nwe found him feasting beside his wife and many children.\nReaching the doorposts at the threshold, down we sat\nbut our hosts, amazed to see us, only shouted questions:\n70  ‘Back again, Odysseus —why? Some blustering god attacked you?\nSurely we launched you well, we sped you on your way\nto your own land and house, or any place you pleased.’\nSo they taunted, and I replied in deep despair,\n‘A mutinous crew undid me —that and a cruel sleep.\nSet it to rights, my friends. You have the power!’\nSo I pleaded —gentle, humble appeals —\nbut our hosts turned silent, hushed . . .\nand the father broke forth with an ultimatum:\n‘Away from my island —fast —most cursed man alive!\n80  It’s a crime to host a man or speed him on his way\nwhen the blessed deathless gods despise him so.\nCrawling back like this —\nit proves the immortals hate you! Out —get out!’\nGroan as I did, his curses drove me from his halls\nand from there we pulled away with heavy hearts,\nwith the crews’ spirit broken under the oars’ labor,\nthanks to our own folly . . . no favoring wind in sight.\nSix whole days we rowed, six nights, nonstop.\nOn the seventh day we raised the Laestrygonian land,\nTelepylus heights where the craggy fort of Lamus rises.\nWhere shepherd calls to shepherd as one drives in his flocks\nand the other drives his out and he calls back in answer,\nwhere a man who never sleeps could rake in double wages,\none for herding cattle, one for pasturing fleecy sheep,\nthe nightfall and the sunrise march so close together.\nWe entered a fine harbor there, all walled around\nby a great unbroken sweep of sky-scraping cliff\nand two steep headlands, fronting each other, close\naround the mouth so the passage in is cramped.\n100  Here the rest of my rolling squadron steered,\nright into the gaping cove and moored tightly,\nprow by prow. Never a swell there, big or small;\na milk-white calm spreads all around the place.\nBut I alone anchored my black ship outside,\nwell clear of the harbor’s jaws\nI tied her fast to a cliffside with a cable.\nI scaled its rock face to a lookout on its crest\nbut glimpsed no trace of the work of man or beast from there;\nall I spied was a plume of smoke, drifting off the land.\n110  So I sent some crew ahead to learn who lived there —\nmen like us perhaps, who live on bread?\nTwo good mates I chose and a third to run the news.\nThey disembarked and set out on a beaten trail\nthe wagons used for hauling timber down to town\nfrom the mountain heights above . . .\nand before the walls they met a girl, drawing water,\nAntiphates’ strapping daughter —king of the Laestrygonians.\nShe’d come down to a clear running spring, Artacia,\nwhere the local people came to fill their pails.\n120  My shipmates clustered round her, asking questions:\nwho was king of the realm? who ruled the natives here?\nShe waved at once to her father’s high-roofed halls.\nThey entered the sumptuous palace, found his wife inside —\na woman huge as a mountain crag who filled them all with horror.\nStraightaway she summoned royal Antiphates from assembly,\nher husband, who prepared my crew a barbarous welcome.\nSnatching one of my men, he tore him up for dinner —\nthe other two sprang free and reached the ships.\nBut the king let loose a howling through the town\n130  that brought tremendous Laestrygonians swarming up\nfrom every side —hundreds, not like men, like Giants!\nDown from the cliffs they flung great rocks a man could hardly hoist\nand a ghastly shattering din rose up from all the ships —\nmen in their death-cries, hulls smashed to splinters —\nThey speared the crews like fish\nand whisked them home to make their grisly meal.\nBut while they killed them off in the harbor depths\nI pulled the sword from beside my hip and hacked away\nat the ropes that moored my blue-prowed ship of war\n140  and shouted rapid orders at my shipmates:\n‘Put your backs in the oars —now row or die!’\nIn terror of death they ripped the swells —all as one —\nand what a joy as we darted out toward open sea,\nclear of those beetling cliffs . . . my ship alone.\nBut the rest went down en masse. Our squadron sank.\nFrom there we sailed on, glad to escape our death\nyet sick at heart for the dear companions we had lost.\nWe reached the Aeaean island next, the home of Circe\nthe nymph with lovely braids, an awesome power too\n150  who can speak with human voice,\nthe true sister of murderous-minded Aeetes.\nBoth were bred by the Sun who lights our lives;\ntheir mother was Perse, a child the Ocean bore.\nWe brought our ship to port without a sound\nas a god eased her into a harbor safe and snug,\nand for two days and two nights we lay by there,\neating our hearts out, bent with pain and bone-tired.\nWhen Dawn with her lovely locks brought on the third day,\nat last I took my spear and my sharp sword again,\n160  rushed up from the ship to find a lookout point,\nhoping to glimpse some sign of human labor,\ncatch some human voices . . .\nI scaled a commanding crag and, scanning hard,\nI could just make out some smoke from Circe’s halls,\ndrifting up from the broad terrain through brush and woods.\nMulling it over, I thought I’d scout the ground —\nthat fire aglow in the smoke, I saw it, true,\nbut soon enough this seemed the better plan:\nI’d go back to shore and the swift ship first,\n170  feed the men, then send them out for scouting.\nI was well on my way down, nearing our ship\nwhen a god took pity on me, wandering all alone;\nhe sent me a big stag with high branching antlers,\nright across my path —the sun’s heat forced him down\nfrom his forest range to drink at a river’s banks —\njust bounding out of the timber when I hit him\nsquare in the backbone, halfway down the spine\nand my bronze spear went punching clean through —\nhe dropped in the dust, groaning, gasping out his breath.\n180  Treading on him, I wrenched my bronze spear from the wound,\nleft it there on the ground, and snapping off some twigs\nand creepers, twisted a rope about a fathom long,\nI braided it tight, hand over hand, then lashed\nthe four hocks of that magnificent beast.\nLoaded round my neck I lugged him toward the ship,\ntrudging, propped on my spear —no way to sling him\nover a shoulder, steadying him with one free arm —\nthe kill was so immense!\nI flung him down by the hull and roused the men,\n190  going up to them all with a word to lift their spirits:\n‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship —\nwe won’t go down to the House of Death, not yet,\nnot till our day arrives. Up with you, look,\nthere’s still some meat and drink in our good ship.\nPut our minds on food —why die of hunger here?’\nMy hardy urging brought them round at once.\nHeads came up from cloaks and there by the barren sea\nthey gazed at the stag, their eyes wide —my noble trophy.\nBut once they’d looked their fill and warmed their hearts,\n200  they washed their hands and prepared a splendid meal.\nNow all day long till the sun went down we sat\nand feasted on sides of meat and seasoned wine.\nThen when the sun had set and night came on\nwe lay down and slept at the water’s shelving edge.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nI called a muster quickly, informing all the crew,\n‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship,\nwe can’t tell east from west, the dawn from the dusk,\nnor where the sun that lights our lives goes under earth\n210  nor where it rises. We must think of a plan at once,\nsome cunning stroke. I doubt there’s one still left.\nI scaled a commanding crag and from that height\nsurveyed an entire island\nringed like a crown by endless wastes of sea.\nBut the land itself lies low, and I did see smoke\ndrifting up from its heart through thick brush and woods.’\nMy message broke their spirit as they recalled\nthe gruesome work of the Laestrygonian king Antiphates\nand the hearty cannibal Cyclops thirsting for our blood.\n220  They burst into cries, wailing, streaming live tears\nthat gained us nothing —what good can come of grief?\nAnd so, numbering off my band of men-at-arms\ninto two platoons, I assigned them each a leader:\nI took one and lord Eurylochus the other.\nWe quickly shook lots in a bronze helmet —\nthe lot of brave Eurylochus leapt out first.\nSo he moved off with his two and twenty comrades,\nweeping, leaving us behind in tears as well . . .\nDeep in the wooded glens they came on Circe’s palace\n230  built of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land.\nMountain wolves and lions were roaming round the grounds —\nshe’d bewitched them herself, she gave them magic drugs.\nBut they wouldn’t attack my men; they just came pawing\nup around them, fawning, swishing their long tails —\neager as hounds that fawn around their master,\ncoming home from a feast,\nwho always brings back scraps to calm them down.\nSo they came nuzzling round my men —lions, wolves\nwith big powerful claws —and the men cringed in fear\n240  at the sight of those strange, ferocious beasts . . . But still\nthey paused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids,\nCirce —and deep inside they heard her singing, lifting\nher spellbinding voice as she glided back and forth\nat her great immortal loom, her enchanting web\na shimmering glory only goddesses can weave.\nPolites, captain of armies, took command,\nthe closest, most devoted man I had: ‘Friends,\nthere’s someone inside, plying a great loom,\nand how she sings —enthralling!\n250  The whole house is echoing to her song.\nGoddess or woman —let’s call out to her now!’\nSo he urged and the men called out and hailed her.\nShe opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth,\ninviting them all in, and in they went, all innocence.\nOnly Eurylochus stayed behind —he sensed a trap . . .\nShe ushered them in to sit on high-backed chairs,\nthen she mixed them a potion —cheese, barley\nand pale honey mulled in Pramnian wine —\nbut into the brew she stirred her wicked drugs\n260  to wipe from their memories any thought of home.\nOnce they’d drained the bowls she filled, suddenly\nshe struck with her wand, drove them into her pigsties,\nall of them bristling into swine —with grunts,\nsnouts —even their bodies, yes, and only\nthe men’s minds stayed steadfast as before.\nSo off they went to their pens, sobbing, squealing\nas Circe flung them acorns, cornel nuts and mast,\ncommon fodder for hogs that root and roll in mud.\nBack Eurylochus ran to our swift black ship\n270  to tell the disaster our poor friends had faced.\nBut try as he might, he couldn’t get a word out.\nNumbing sorrow had stunned the man to silence —\ntears welled in his eyes, his heart possessed by grief.\nWe assailed him with questions —all at our wits’ end —\ntill at last he could recount the fate our friends had met:\n‘Off we went through the brush, captain, as you commanded.\nDeep in the wooded glens we came on Circe’s palace\nbuilt of dressed stone on a cleared rise of land.\nSomeone inside was plying a great loom,\n280  and how she sang —in a high clear voice!\nGoddess or woman —we called out and hailed her . . .\nShe opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth,\ninviting us all in, and in we went, all innocence.\nBut I stayed behind —I sensed a trap. Suddenly\nall vanished —blotted out —not one face showed again,\nthough I sat there keeping watch a good long time.’\nAt that report I slung the hefty bronze blade\nof my silver-studded sword around my shoulder,\nslung my bow on too and told our comrade,\n290  ‘Lead me back by the same way that you came.’\nBut he flung both arms around my knees and pleaded,\nbegging me with his tears and winging words:\n‘Don’t force me back there, captain, king —\nleave me here on the spot.\nYou will never return yourself, I swear,\nyou’ll never bring back a single man alive.\nQuick, cut and run with the rest of us here —\nwe can still escape the fatal day!’\nBut I shot back, ‘Eurylochus, stay right here,\n300  eating, drinking, safe by the black ship.\nI must be off. Necessity drives me on.’\nLeaving the ship and shore, I headed inland,\nclambering up through hushed, entrancing glades until,\nas I was nearing the halls of Circe skilled in spells,\napproaching her palace —Hermes god of the golden wand\ncrossed my path, and he looked for all the world\nlike a young man sporting his first beard,\njust in the prime and warm pride of youth,\nand grasped me by the hand and asked me kindly,\n310  ‘Where are you going now, my unlucky friend —\ntrekking over the hills alone in unfamiliar country?\nAnd your men are all in there, in Circe’s palace,\ncooped like swine, hock by jowl in the sties.\nHave you come to set them free?\nWell, I warn you, you won’t get home yourself,\nyou’ll stay right there, trapped with all the rest.\nBut wait, I can save you, free you from that great danger.\nLook, here is a potent drug. Take it to Circe’s halls —\nits power alone will shield you from the fatal day.\n320  Let me tell you of all the witch’s subtle craft . . .\nShe’ll mix you a potion, lace the brew with drugs\nbut she’ll be powerless to bewitch you, even so —\nthis magic herb I give will fight her spells.\nNow here’s your plan of action, step by step.\nThe moment Circe strikes with her long thin wand,\nyou draw your sharp sword sheathed at your hip\nand rush her fast as if to run her through!\nShe’ll cower in fear and coax you to her bed —\nbut don’t refuse the goddess’ bed, not then, not if\n330  she’s to release your friends and treat you well yourself.\nBut have her swear the binding oath of the blessed gods\nshe’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm you,\nonce you lie there naked —\nnever unman you, strip away your courage!’\nthe giant-killer handed over the magic herb,\npulling it from the earth,\nand Hermes showed me all its name and nature.\nIts root is black and its flower white as milk\nand the gods call it moly. Dangerous for a mortal man\n340  to pluck from the soil but not for deathless gods.\nAll lies within their power.\nNow Hermes went his way\nto the steep heights of Olympus, over the island’s woods\nwhile I, just approaching the halls of Circe,\nmy heart a heaving storm at every step,\npaused at her doors, the nymph with lovely braids —\nI stood and shouted to her there. She heard my voice,\nshe opened her gleaming doors at once and stepped forth,\ninviting me in, and in I went, all anguish now . . .\nShe led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair,\n350  ornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet.\nIn a golden bowl she mixed a potion for me to drink,\nstirring her poison in, her heart aswirl with evil.\nAnd then she passed it on, I drank it down\nbut it never worked its spell —\nshe struck with her wand and ‘Now,’ she cried,\n‘off to your sty, you swine, and wallow with your friends!’\nBut I, I drew my sharp sword sheathed at my hip\nand rushed her fast as if to run her through —\nShe screamed, slid under my blade, hugged my knees\n360  with a flood of warm tears and a burst of winging words:\n‘Who are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?\nI’m wonderstruck —you drank my drugs, you’re not bewitched!\nNever has any other man withstood my potion, never,\nonce it’s past his lips and he has drunk it down.\nYou have a mind in you no magic can enchant!\nYou must be Odysseus, man of twists and turns —\nHermes the giant-killer, god of the golden wand,\nhe always said you’d come,\nhomeward bound from Troy in your swift black ship.\n370  Come, sheathe your sword, let’s go to bed together,\nmount my bed and mix in the magic work of love —\nwe’ll breed deep trust between us.’\nSo she enticed\nbut I fought back, still wary. ‘Circe, Circe,\nhow dare you tell me to treat you with any warmth?\nYou who turned my men to swine in your own house and now\nyou hold me here as well —teeming with treachery\nyou lure me to your room to mount your bed,\nso once I lie there naked\nyou’ll unman me, strip away my courage!\n380  Mount your bed? Not for all the world. Not\nuntil you consent to swear, goddess, a binding oath\nyou’ll never plot some new intrigue to harm me!’\nStraightaway\nshe began to swear the oath that I required —never,\nshe’d never do me harm —and when she’d finished,\nthen, at last, I mounted Circe’s gorgeous bed . . .\nAt the same time her handmaids bustled through the halls,\nfour in all who perform the goddess’ household tasks:\nnymphs, daughters born of the springs and groves\nand the sacred rivers running down to open sea.\n390  One draped the chairs with fine crimson covers\nover the seats she’d spread with linen cloths below.\nA second drew up silver tables before the chairs\nand laid out golden trays to hold the bread.\nA third mulled heady, heart-warming wine\nin a silver bowl and set out golden cups.\nA fourth brought water and lit a blazing fire\nbeneath a massive cauldron. The water heated soon,\nand once it reached the boil in the glowing bronze\nshe eased me into a tub and bathed me from the cauldron,\n400  mixing the hot and cold to suit my taste, showering\nhead and shoulders down until she’d washed away\nthe spirit-numbing exhaustion from my body.\nThe bathing finished, rubbing me sleek with oil,\nthrowing warm fleece and a shirt around my shoulders,\nshe led me in to sit on a silver-studded chair,\nornately carved, with a stool to rest my feet.\nA maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher\nand over a silver basin tipped it out\nso I might rinse my hands,\n410  then pulled a gleaming table to my side.\nA staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve me,\nappetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.\nShe pressed me to eat. I had no taste for food.\nI just sat there, mind wandering, far away . . .\nlost in grim forebodings.\nAs soon as Circe saw me,\nhuddled, not touching my food, immersed in sorrow,\nshe sidled near with a coaxing, winged word:\n‘Odysseus, why just sit there, struck dumb,\neating your heart out, not touching food or drink?\n420  Suspect me of still more treachery? Nothing to fear.\nHaven’t I just sworn my solemn, binding oath?’\nSo she asked, but I protested, ‘Circe —\nhow could any man in his right mind endure\nthe taste of food and drink before he’d freed\nhis comrades-in-arms and looked them in the eyes?\nIf you, you really want me to eat and drink,\nset them free, all my beloved comrades —\nlet me feast my eyes.’\nSo I demanded.\nCirce strode on through the halls and out,\n430  her wand held high in hand and, flinging open the pens,\ndrove forth my men, who looked like full-grown swine.\nFacing her, there they stood as she went along the ranks,\nanointing them one by one with some new magic oil —\nand look, the bristles grown by the first wicked drug\nthat Circe gave them slipped away from their limbs\nand they turned men again: younger than ever,\ntaller by far, more handsome to the eye, and yes,\nthey knew me at once and each man grasped my hands\nand a painful longing for tears overcame us all,\n440  a terrible sobbing echoed through the house . . .\nThe goddess herself was moved and, standing by me,\nwarmly urged me on —a lustrous goddess now:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, tried and true,\ngo at once to your ship at the water’s edge,\nhaul her straight up on the shore first\nand stow your cargo and running gear in caves,\nthen back you come and bring your trusty crew.’\nHer urging won my stubborn spirit over.\nDown I went to the swift ship at the water’s edge,\n450  and there on the decks I found my loyal crew\nconsumed with grief and weeping live warm tears.\nBut now, as calves in stalls when cows come home,\ndroves of them herded back from field to farmyard\nonce they’ve grazed their fill —as all their young calves\ncome frisking out to meet them, bucking out of their pens,\nlowing nonstop, jostling, rushing round their mothers —\nso my shipmates there at the sight of my return\ncame pressing round me now, streaming tears,\nso deeply moved in their hearts they felt as if\n460  they’d made it back to their own land, their city,\nIthaca’s rocky soil where they were bred and reared.\nAnd through their tears their words went winging home:\n‘You’re back again, my king! How thrilled we are —\nas if we’d reached our country, Ithaca, at last!\nBut come, tell us about the fate our comrades met.’\nStill I replied with a timely word of comfort:\n‘Let’s haul our ship straight up on the shore first\nand stow our cargo and running gear in caves.\nThen hurry, all of you, come along with me\n470  to see our friends in the magic halls of Circe,\neating and drinking —the feast flows on forever.’\nSo I said and they jumped to do my bidding.\nOnly Eurylochus tried to hold my shipmates back,\nhis mutinous outburst aimed at one and all:\n‘Poor fools, where are we running now?\nWhy are we tempting fate? —\nwhy stumble blindly down to Circe’s halls?\nShe’ll turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions\nmade to guard that palace of hers —by force, I tell you —\n480  just as the Cyclops trapped our comrades in his lair\nwith hotheaded Odysseus right beside them all —\nthanks to this man’s rashness they died too!’\nSo he declared and I had half a mind\nto draw the sharp sword from beside my hip\nand slice his head off, tumbling down in the dust,\nclose kin that he was. But comrades checked me,\neach man trying to calm me, left and right:\n‘Captain, we’ll leave him here if you command,\njust where he is, to sit and guard the ship.\nLead us on to the magic halls of Circe.’\n490                                          With that,\nup from the ship and shore they headed inland.\nNor did Eurylochus malinger by the hull;\nhe straggled behind the rest,\ndreading the sharp blast of my rebuke.\nAll the while\nCirce had bathed my other comrades in her palace,\ncaring and kindly, rubbed them sleek with oil\nand decked them out in fleecy cloaks and shirts.\nWe found them all together, feasting in her halls.\nOnce we had recognized each other, gazing face-to-face,\n500  we all broke down and wept —and the house resounded now\nand Circe the lustrous one came toward me, pleading,\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of action,\nno more tears now, calm these tides of sorrow.\nWell I know what pains you bore on the swarming sea,\nwhat punishment you endured from hostile men on land.\nBut come now, eat your food and drink your wine\ntill the same courage fills your chests, now as then,\nwhen you first set sail from native land, from rocky Ithaca!\nNow you are burnt-out husks, your spirits haggard, sere,\n510  always brooding over your wanderings long and hard,\nyour hearts never lifting with any joy —\nyou’ve suffered far too much.’\nSo she enticed\nand won our battle-hardened spirits over.\nAnd there we sat at ease,\nday in, day out, till a year had run its course,\nfeasting on sides of meat and drafts of heady wine . . .\nBut then, when the year was gone and the seasons wheeled by\nand the months waned and the long days came round again,\nmy loyal comrades took me aside and prodded,\n‘Captain, this is madness!\nHigh time you thought of your own home at last,\nif it really is your fate to make it back alive\nand reach your well-built house and native land.’\nTheir urging brought my stubborn spirit round.\nSo all that day till the sun went down we sat\nand feasted on sides of meat and heady wine.\nThen when the sun had set and night came on\nthe men lay down to sleep in the shadowed halls\nbut I went up to that luxurious bed of Circe’s,\nhugged her by the knees\nand the goddess heard my winging supplication:\n‘Circe, now make good a promise you gave me once —\nit’s time to help me home. My heart longs to be home,\nmy comrades’ hearts as well. They wear me down,\npleading with me whenever you’re away.’\nSo I pressed\nand the lustrous goddess answered me in turn:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,\nstay on no more in my house against your will.\nBut first another journey calls. You must travel down\nto the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone,\nthere to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes,\nthe great blind prophet whose mind remains unshaken.\nEven in death —Persephone has given him wisdom,\neverlasting vision to him and him alone . . .\nthe rest of the dead are empty, flitting shades.’\nSo she said and crushed the heart inside me.\nI knelt in her bed and wept. I’d no desire\nto go on living and see the rising light of day.\nBut once I’d had my fill of tears and writhing there,\n550  at last I found the words to venture, ‘Circe, Circe,\nwho can pilot us on that journey? Who has ever\nreached the House of Death in a black ship?’\nThe lustrous goddess answered, never pausing,\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, born for exploits,\nlet no lack of a pilot at the helm concern you, no,\njust step your mast and spread your white sail wide —\nsit back and the North Wind will speed you on your way.\nBut once your vessel has cut across the Ocean River\nyou will raise a desolate coast and Persephone’s Grove,\n560  her tall black poplars, willows whose fruit dies young.\nBeach your vessel hard by the Ocean’s churning shore\nand make your own way down to the moldering House of Death.\nAnd there into Acheron, the Flood of Grief, two rivers flow,\nthe torrent River of Fire, the wailing River of Tears\nthat branches off from Styx, the Stream of Hate,\nand a stark crag looms\nwhere the two rivers thunder down and meet.\nOnce there, go forward, hero. Do as I say now.\nDig a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length\n570  and around it pour libations out to all the dead —\nfirst with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine,\nthen water third and last, and sprinkle glistening barley\nover it all, and vow again and again to all the dead,\nto the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts,\nthat once you return to Ithaca you will slaughter\na barren heifer in your halls, the best you have,\nand load a pyre with treasures —and to Tiresias,\nalone, apart, you will offer a sleek black ram,\nthe pride of all your herds. And once your prayers\n580  have invoked the nations of the dead in their dim glory,\nslaughter a ram and a black ewe, turning both their heads\ntoward Erebus, but turn your head away, looking toward\nthe Ocean River. Suddenly then the countless shades\nof the dead and gone will surge around you there.\nBut order your men at once to flay the sheep\nthat lie before you, killed by your ruthless blade,\nand burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods,\nto the almighty god of death and dread Persephone.\nBut you —draw your sharp sword from beside your hip,\n590  sit down on alert there, and never let the ghosts\nof the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood\ntill you have questioned Tiresias yourself. Soon, soon\nthe great seer will appear before you, captain of armies:\nhe will tell you the way to go, the stages of your voyage,\nhow you can cross the swarming sea and reach home at last.’\nAnd with those words Dawn rose on her golden throne\nand Circe dressed me quickly in sea-cloak and shirt\nwhile the queen slipped on a loose, glistening robe,\nfilmy, a joy to the eye, and round her waist\n600  she ran a brocaded golden belt\nand over her head a scarf to shield her brow.\nAnd I strode on through the halls to stir my men,\nhovering over each with a winning word: ‘Up now!\nNo more lazing away in sleep, we must set sail —\nQueen Circe has shown the way.’\nI brought them round,\nmy hardy friends-in-arms, but not even from there\ncould I get them safely off without a loss . . .\nThere was a man, Elpenor, the youngest in our ranks,\nnone too brave in battle, none too sound in mind.\n610  He’d strayed from his mates in Circe’s magic halls\nand keen for the cool night air,\nsodden with wine he’d bedded down on her roofs.\nBut roused by the shouts and tread of marching men,\nhe leapt up with a start at dawn but still so dazed\nhe forgot to climb back down again by the long ladder —\nheadfirst from the roof he plunged, his neck snapped\nfrom the backbone, his soul flew down to Death.\nOnce on our way, I gave the men their orders:\n‘You think we are headed home, our own dear land?\n620  Well, Circe sets us a rather different course . . .\ndown to the House of Death and the awesome one, Persephone,\nthere to consult the ghost of Tiresias, seer of Thebes.’\nSo I said, and it broke my shipmates’ hearts.\nThey sank down on the ground, moaning, tore their hair.\nBut it gained us nothing —what good can come of grief?\nBack to the swift ship at the water’s edge we went,\nour spirits deep in anguish, faces wet with tears.\nBut Circe got to the dark hull before us,\ntethered a ram and black ewe close by —\n630  slipping past unseen. Who can glimpse a god\nwho wants to be invisible gliding here and there?”"

The eye of the Sun can never\nflash his rays through the dark and bring them light,\nnot when he climbs the starry skies or when he wheels\n20  back down from the heights to touch the earth once more —\nan endless, deadly night overhangs those wretched men.\nThere, gaining that point, we beached our craft\nand herding out the sheep, we picked our way\nby the Ocean’s banks until we gained the place\nthat Circe made our goal.\nHere at the spot\nPerimedes and Eurylochus held the victims fast,\nand I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my hip,\ndug a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length\nand around it poured libations out to all the dead,\n30  first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine,\nthen water third and last, and sprinkled glistening barley\nover it all, and time and again I vowed to all the dead,\nto the drifting, listless spirits of their ghosts,\nthat once I returned to Ithaca I would slaughter\na barren heifer in my halls, the best I had,\nand load a pyre with treasures —and to Tiresias,\nalone, apart, I would offer a sleek black ram,\nthe pride of all my herds. And once my vows\nand prayers had invoked the nations of the dead,\n40  I took the victims, over the trench I cut their throats\nand the dark blood flowed in —and up out of Erebus they came,\nflocking toward me now, the ghosts of the dead and gone . . .\nBrides and unwed youths and old men who had suffered much\nand girls with their tender hearts freshly scarred by sorrow\nand great armies of battle dead, stabbed by bronze spears,\nmen of war still wrapped in bloody armor —thousands\nswarming around the trench from every side —\nunearthly cries —blanching terror gripped me!\nI ordered the men at once to flay the sheep\n50  that lay before us, killed by my ruthless blade,\nand burn them both, and then say prayers to the gods,\nto the almighty god of death and dread Persephone.\nBut I, the sharp sword drawn from beside my hip,\nsat down on alert there and never let the ghosts\nof the shambling, shiftless dead come near that blood\ntill I had questioned Tiresias myself.\nthe ghost of Elpenor, my companion, came toward me.\nHe’d not been buried under the wide ways of earth,\nnot yet, we’d left his body in Circe’s house,\n60  unwept, unburied —this other labor pressed us.\nBut I wept to see him now, pity touched my heart\nand I called out a winged word to him there: ‘Elpenor,\nhow did you travel down to the world of darkness?\nFaster on foot, I see, than I in my black ship.’\nMy comrade groaned as he offered me an answer:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,\nthe doom of an angry god, and god knows how much wine —\nthey were my ruin, captain . . . I’d bedded down\non the roof of Circe’s house but never thought\n70  to climb back down again by the long ladder —\nheadfirst from the roof I plunged, my neck snapped\nfrom the backbone, my soul flew down to Death. Now,\nI beg you by those you left behind, so far from here,\nyour wife, your father who bred and reared you as a boy,\nand Telemachus, left at home in your halls, your only son.\nWell I know when you leave this lodging of the dead\nthat you and your ship will put ashore again\nat the island of Aeaea —then and there,\nmy lord, remember me, I beg you! Don’t sail off\n80  and desert me, left behind unwept, unburied, don’t,\nor my curse may draw god’s fury on your head.\nNo, burn me in full armor, all my harness,\nheap my mound by the churning gray surf —\na man whose luck ran out —\nso even men to come will learn my story.\nPerform my rites, and plant on my tomb that oar\nI swung with mates when I rowed among the living.’\n‘All this, my unlucky friend,’ I reassured him,\n‘I will do for you. I won’t forget a thing.’\n90  and faced each other, trading our bleak parting words,\nI on my side, holding my sword above the blood,\nhe across from me there, my comrade’s phantom\ndragging out his story.\nBut look, the ghost\nof my mother came! My mother, dead and gone now . . .\nAnticleia —daughter of that great heart Autolycus —\nwhom I had left alive when I sailed for sacred Troy.\nI broke into tears to see her here, but filled with pity,\neven throbbing with grief, I would not let her ghost\napproach the blood till I had questioned Tiresias myself.\n100    At last he came. The shade of the famous Theban prophet,\nholding a golden scepter, knew me at once and hailed me:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, master of exploits,\nman of pain, what now, what brings you here,\nforsaking the light of day\nto see this joyless kingdom of the dead?\nStand back from the trench —put up your sharp sword\nso I can drink the blood and tell you all the truth.’\nMoving back, I thrust my silver-studded sword\ndeep in its sheath, and once he had drunk the dark blood\n110  the words came ringing from the prophet in his power:\n‘A sweet smooth journey home, renowned Odysseus,\nthat is what you seek\nbut a god will make it hard for you —I know —\nyou will never escape the one who shakes the earth,\nquaking with anger at you still, still enraged\nbecause you blinded the Cyclops, his dear son.\nEven so, you and your crew may still reach home,\nsuffering all the way, if you only have the power\nto curb their wild desire and curb your own, what’s more,\n120  from the day your good trim vessel first puts in\nat Thrinacia Island, flees the cruel blue sea.\nThere you will find them grazing,\nherds and fat flocks, the cattle of Helios,\ngod of the sun who sees all, hears all things.\nLeave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home,\nand you all may still reach Ithaca —bent with hardship,\ntrue —but harm them in any way, and I can see it now:\nyour ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well.\nAnd even if you escape, you’ll come home late\n130  and come a broken man —all shipmates lost,\nalone in a stranger’s ship —\nand you will find a world of pain at home,\ncrude, arrogant men devouring all your goods,\ncourting your noble wife, offering gifts to win her.\nNo doubt you will pay them back in blood when you come home!\nBut once you have killed those suitors in your halls —\nby stealth or in open fight with slashing bronze —\ngo forth once more, you must . . .\ncarry your well-planed oar until you come\n140  to a race of people who know nothing of the sea,\nwhose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all\nto ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars,\nwings that make ships fly. And here is your sign —\nunmistakable, clear, so clear you cannot miss it:\nWhen another traveler falls in with you and calls\nthat weight across your shoulder a fan to winnow grain,\nthen plant your bladed, balanced oar in the earth\nand sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea,\nPoseidon —a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar —\n150  then journey home and render noble offerings up\nto the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies,\nto all the gods in order.\nAnd at last your own death will steal upon you . . .\na gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes\nto take you down, borne down with the years in ripe old age\nwith all your people there in blessed peace around you.\nAll that I have told you will come true.’\n‘Oh Tiresias,’\nI replied as the prophet finished, ‘surely the gods\nhave spun this out as fate, the gods themselves.\n160  But tell me one thing more, and tell me clearly.\nI see the ghost of my long-lost mother here before me.\nDead, crouching close to the blood in silence,\nshe cannot bear to look me in the eyes —\nher own son —or speak a word to me. How,\nlord, can I make her know me for the man I am?’\n‘One rule there is,’ the famous seer explained,\n‘and simple for me to say and you to learn.\nAny one of the ghosts you let approach the blood\nwill speak the truth to you. Anyone you refuse\nwill turn and fade away.’\n170                                And with those words,\nnow that his prophecies had closed, the awesome shade\nof lord Tiresias strode back to the House of Death.\nBut I kept watch there, steadfast till my mother\napproached and drank the dark, clouding blood.\nShe knew me at once and wailed out in grief\nand her words came winging toward me, flying home:\n‘Oh my son —what brings you down to the world\nof death and darkness? You are still alive!\nIt’s hard for the living to catch a glimpse of this . . .\n180  Great rivers flow between us, terrible waters,\nthe Ocean first of all —no one could ever ford\nthat stream on foot, only aboard some sturdy craft.\nHave you just come from Troy, wandering long years\nwith your men and ship? Not yet returned to Ithaca?\nYou’ve still not seen your wife inside your halls?’\nI replied, ‘I had to venture down to the House of Death,\nto consult the shade of Tiresias, seer of Thebes.\nNever yet have I neared Achaea, never once\nset foot on native ground,\n190  always wandering —endless hardship from that day\nI first set sail with King Agamemnon bound for Troy,\nthe stallion-land, to fight the Trojans there.\nBut tell me about yourself and spare me nothing.\nWhat form of death overcame you, what laid you low,\nsome long slow illness? Or did Artemis showering arrows\ncome with her painless shafts and bring you down?\nTell me of father, tell of the son I left behind:\ndo my royal rights still lie in their safekeeping?\nOr does some stranger hold the throne by now\n200  because men think that I’ll come home no more?\nPlease, tell me about my wife, her turn of mind,\nher thoughts . . . still standing fast beside our son,\nstill guarding our great estates, secure as ever now?\nOr has she wed some other countryman at last,\nthe finest prince among them?’\n‘Surely, surely,’\nmy noble mother answered quickly, ‘she’s still waiting\nthere in your halls, poor woman, suffering so,\nher life an endless hardship like your own . . .\nwasting away the nights, weeping away the days.\n210  No one has taken over your royal rights, not yet.\nTelemachus still holds your great estates in peace,\nhe attends the public banquets shared with all,\nthe feasts a man of justice should enjoy,\nfor every lord invites him. As for your father,\nhe keeps to his own farm —he never goes to town —\nwith no bed for him there, no blankets, glossy throws;\nall winter long he sleeps in the lodge with servants,\nin the ashes by the fire, his body wrapped in rags.\nBut when summer comes and the bumper crops of harvest,\n220  any spot on the rising ground of his vineyard rows\nhe makes his bed, heaped high with fallen leaves,\nand there he lies in anguish . . .\nwith his old age bearing hard upon him, too,\nand his grief grows as he longs for your return.\nAnd I with the same grief, I died and met my fate.\nNo sharp-eyed Huntress showering arrows through the halls\napproached and brought me down with painless shafts,\nnor did some hateful illness strike me, that so often\ndevastates the body, drains our limbs of power.\n230  No, it was my longing for you, my shining Odysseus —\nyou and your quickness, you and your gentle ways —\nthat tore away my life that had been sweet.’\nAnd I, my mind in turmoil, how I longed\nto embrace my mother’s spirit, dead as she was!\nThree times I rushed toward her, desperate to hold her,\nthree times she fluttered through my fingers, sifting away\nlike a shadow, dissolving like a dream, and each time\nthe grief cut to the heart, sharper, yes, and I,\nI cried out to her, words winging into the darkness:\n240  ‘Mother —why not wait for me? How I long to hold you! —\nso even here, in the House of Death, we can fling\nour loving arms around each other, take some joy\nin the tears that numb the heart. Or is this just\nsome wraith that great Persephone sends my way\nto make me ache with sorrow all the more?’\nMy noble mother answered me at once:\n‘My son, my son, the unluckiest man alive!\nThis is no deception sent by Queen Persephone,\nthis is just the way of mortals when we die.\n250  Sinews no longer bind the flesh and bones together —\nthe fire in all its fury burns the body down to ashes\nonce life slips from the white bones, and the spirit,\nrustling, flitters away . . . flown like a dream.\nBut you must long for the daylight. Go, quickly.\nRemember all these things\nso one day you can tell them to your wife.’\nAnd so we both confided, trading parting words,\nand there slowly came a grand array of women,\nall sent before me now by august Persephone,\n260  and all were wives and daughters once of princes.\nThey swarmed in a flock around the dark blood\nwhile I searched for a way to question each alone,\nand the more I thought, the more this seemed the best:\nDrawing forth the long sharp sword from beside my hip,\nI would not let them drink the dark blood, all in a rush,\nand so they waited, coming forward one after another.\nEach declared her lineage, and I explored them all.\nAnd the first I saw there? Tyro, born of kings,\nwho said her father was that great lord Salmoneus,\nsaid that she was the wife of Cretheus, Aeolus’ son.\nAnd once she fell in love with the river god, Enipeus,\nfar the clearest river flowing across the earth,\nand so she’d haunt Enipeus’ glinting streams,\ntill taking his shape one day\nthe god who girds the earth and makes it tremble\nbedded her where the swirling river rushes out to sea,\nand a surging wave reared up, high as a mountain, dark,\narching over to hide the god and mortal girl together.\nLoosing her virgin belt, he lapped her round in sleep\n280  and when the god had consummated his work of love\nhe took her by the hand and hailed her warmly:\n‘Rejoice in our love, my lady! And when this year\nhas run its course you will give birth to glorious children —\nbedding down with the gods is never barren, futile —\nand you must tend them, breed and rear them well.\nNow home you go, and restrain yourself, I say,\nnever breathe your lover’s name but know —\nI am Poseidon, god who rocks the earth!’\nWith that he dove back in the heaving waves\nand she conceived for the god and bore him Pelias, Neleus,\nand both grew up to be stalwart aides of Zeus almighty,\nboth men alike. Pelias lived on the plains of Iolcos,\nrich in sheepflocks, Neleus lived in sandy Pylos.\nAnd the noble queen bore sons to Cretheus too:\nAeson, Pheres and Amythaon, exultant charioteer.\nAnd after Tyro I saw Asopus’ daughter Antiope,\nproud she’d spent a night in the arms of Zeus himself\nand borne the god twin sons, Amphion and Zethus,\nthe first to build the footings of seven-gated Thebes,\n300  her bastions too, for lacking ramparts none could live\nin a place so vast, so open —strong as both men were.\nAnd I saw Alcmena next, Amphitryon’s wife,\nwho slept in the clasp of Zeus and merged in love\nand brought forth Heracles, rugged will and lion heart.\nAnd I saw Megara too, magnanimous Creon’s daughter\nwed to the stalwart Heracles, the hero never daunted.\nAnd I saw the mother of Oedipus, beautiful Epicaste.\nWhat a monstrous thing she did, in all innocence —\nshe married her own son . . .\n310  who’d killed his father, then he married her!\nBut the gods soon made it known to all mankind.\nSo he in growing pain ruled on in beloved Thebes,\nlording Cadmus’ people —thanks to the gods’ brutal plan —\nwhile she went down to Death who guards the massive gates.\nLashing a noose to a steep rafter, there she hanged aloft,\nstrangling in all her anguish, leaving her son to bear\nthe world of horror a mother’s Furies bring to life.\nAnd I saw magnificent Chloris, the one whom Neleus\nwooed and won with a hoard of splendid gifts,\n320  so dazzled by her beauty years ago . . .\nthe youngest daughter of Iasus’ son Amphion,\nthe great Minyan king who ruled Orchomenos once.\nShe was his queen in Pylos, she bore him shining sons,\nNestor and Chromius, Periclymenus too, good prince.\nAnd after her sons she bore a daughter, majestic Pero,\nthe marvel of her time, courted by all the young lords\nround about. But Neleus would not give her to any suitor,\nnone but the man who might drive home the herds\nthat powerful Iphiclus had stolen. Lurching,\n330  broad in the brow, those longhorned beasts,\nand no small task to round them up from Phylace.\nOnly the valiant seer Melampus volunteered —\nhe would drive them home —\nbut a god’s iron sentence bound him fast:\nbarbarous herdsmen dragged him off in chains.\nYet when the months and days had run their course\nand the year wheeled round and the seasons came again,\nthen mighty Iphiclus loosed the prophet’s shackles,\nonce he had told him all the gods’ decrees.\n340  And so the will of Zeus was done at last.\nAnd I saw Leda next, Tyndareus’ wife,\nwho’d borne the king two sons, intrepid twins,\nCastor, breaker of horses, and the hardy boxer Polydeuces,\nboth buried now in the life-giving earth though still alive.\nEven under the earth Zeus grants them that distinction:\none day alive, the next day dead, each twin by turns,\nthey both hold honors equal to the gods’.\nAnd I saw Iphimedeia next, Aloeus’ wife,\nwho claimed she lay in the Sea-lord’s loving waves\n350  and gave the god two sons, but they did not live long,\nOtus staunch as a god and far-famed Ephialtes.\nThey were the tallest men the fertile earth has borne,\nthe handsomest too, by far, aside from renowned Orion.\nNine yards across they measured, even at nine years old,\nnine fathoms tall they towered. They even threatened\nthe deathless gods they’d storm Olympus’ heights\nwith the pounding rush and grinding shock of battle.\nThey were wild to pile Ossa upon Olympus, then on Ossa\nPelion dense with timber —their toeholds up the heavens.\n360  And they’d have won the day if they had reached peak strength\nbut Apollo the son of Zeus, whom sleek-haired Leto bore,\nlaid both giants low before their beards had sprouted,\ncovering cheek and chin with a fresh crop of down.\nPhaedra and Procris too I saw, and lovely Ariadne,\ndaughter of Minos, that harsh king. One day Theseus tried\nto spirit her off from Crete to Athens’ sacred heights\nbut he got no joy from her. Artemis killed her first\non wave-washed Dia’s shores, accused by Dionysus.\nAnd I saw Clymene, Maera and loathsome Eriphyle —\n370  bribed with a golden necklace\nto lure her lawful husband to his death . . .\nBut the whole cortege I could never tally, never name,\nnot all the daughters and wives of great men I saw there.\nLong before that, the godsent night would ebb away.\nBut the time has come for sleep, either with friends\naboard your swift ship or here in your own house.\nMy passage home will rest with the gods and you.”\nOdysseus paused . . . They all fell silent, hushed,\nhis story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls\n380  till the white-armed queen Arete suddenly burst out,\n“Phaeacians! How does this man impress you now,\nhis looks, his build, the balanced mind inside him?\nThe stranger is my guest\nbut each of you princes shares the honor here.\nSo let’s not be too hasty to send him on his way,\nand don’t scrimp on his gifts. His need is great,\ngreat as the riches piled up in your houses,\nthanks to the gods’ good will.”\nFollowing her,\nthe old revered Echeneus added his support,\n390  the eldest lord on the island of Phaeacia:\n“Friends, the words of our considerate queen —\nthey never miss the mark or fail our expectations.\nSo do as Arete says, though on Alcinous here\ndepend all words and action.”\n“And so it will be” —\nAlcinous stepped in grandly —“sure as I am alive\nand rule our island men who love their oars!\nOur guest, much as he longs for passage home,\nmust stay and wait it out here till tomorrow,\ntill I can collect his whole array of parting gifts.\n400  His send-off rests with every noble here\nbut with me most of all:\nI hold the reins of power in the realm.”\nOdysseus, deft and tactful, echoed back,\n“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,\nif you would urge me now to stay here one whole year\nthen speed me home weighed down with lordly gifts,\nI’d gladly have it so. Better by far, that way.\nThe fuller my arms on landing there at home,\nthe more respected, well received I’d be\n410  by all who saw me sailing back to Ithaca.”\n“Ah Odysseus,” Alcinous replied, “one look at you\nand we know that you are no one who would cheat us —\nno fraud, such as the dark soil breeds and spreads\nacross the face of the earth these days. Crowds of vagabonds\nframe their lies so tightly none can test them. But you,\nwhat grace you give your words, and what good sense within!\nYou have told your story with all a singer’s skill,\nthe miseries you endured, your great Achaeans too.\nBut come now, tell me truly: your godlike comrades —\n420  did you see any heroes down in the House of Death,\nany who sailed with you and met their doom at Troy?\nThe night’s still young, I’d say the night is endless.\nFor us in the palace now, it’s hardly time for sleep.\nKeep telling us your adventures —they are wonderful.\nI could hold out here till Dawn’s first light\nif only you could bear, here in our halls,\nto tell the tale of all the pains you suffered.”\nSo the man of countless exploits carried on:\n“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,\n430  there is a time for many words, a time for sleep as well.\nBut if you insist on hearing more, I’d never stint\non telling my own tale and those more painful still,\nthe griefs of my comrades, dead in the war’s wake,\nwho escaped the battle-cries of Trojan armies\nonly to die in blood at journey’s end —\nthanks to a vicious woman’s will.\nno sooner had Queen Persephone driven off\nthe ghosts of lovely women, scattering left and right,\nthan forward marched the shade of Atreus’ son Agamemnon,\n440  fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades,\ntroops of his men-at-arms who died beside him,\nwho met their fate in lord Aegisthus’ halls.\nHe knew me at once, as soon as he drank the blood,\nand wailed out, shrilly; tears sprang to his eyes,\nhe thrust his arms toward me, keen to embrace me there —\nno use —the great force was gone, the strength lost forever,\nnow, that filled his rippling limbs in the old days.\nI wept at the sight, my heart went out to the man,\nmy words too, in a winging flight of pity:\n450  ‘Famous Atrides, lord of men Agamemnon!\nWhat fatal stroke of destiny brought you down?\nWrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused\nsome punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust?\nOr did ranks of enemies mow you down on land\nas you tried to raid and cut off herds and flocks\nor fought to win their city, take their women?’\nThe field marshal’s ghost replied at once:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, mastermind of war,\nI was not wrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon\n460  roused some punishing blast of stormwinds, gust on gust,\nnor did ranks of enemies mow me down on land —\nAegisthus hatched my doom and my destruction,\nhe killed me, he with my own accursed wife . . .\nhe invited me to his palace, sat me down to feast\nthen cut me down as a man cuts down some ox at the trough!\nSo I died —a wretched, ignominious death —and round me\nall my comrades killed, no mercy, one after another,\njust like white-tusked boars\nbutchered in some rich lord of power’s halls\n470  for a wedding, banquet or groaning public feast.\nYou in your day have witnessed hundreds slaughtered,\nkilled in single combat or killed in pitched battle, true,\nbut if you’d laid eyes on this it would have wrenched your heart —\nhow we sprawled by the mixing-bowl and loaded tables there,\nthroughout the palace, the whole floor awash with blood.\nBut the death-cry of Cassandra, Priam’s daughter —\nthe most pitiful thing I heard! My treacherous queen,\nClytemnestra, killed her over my body, yes, and I,\nlifting my fists, beat them down on the ground,\n480  dying, dying, writhing around the sword.\nBut she, that whore, she turned her back on me,\nwell on my way to Death —she even lacked the heart\nto seal my eyes with her hand or close my jaws.\nthere’s nothing more deadly, bestial than a woman\nset on works like these —what a monstrous thing\nshe plotted, slaughtered her own lawful husband!\nWhy, I expected, at least, some welcome home\nfrom all my children, all my household slaves\nwhen I came sailing back again . . . But she —\n490  the queen hell-bent on outrage —bathes in shame\nnot only herself but the whole breed of womankind,\neven the honest ones to come, forever down the years!’\nSo he declared and I cried out, ‘How terrible!\nZeus from the very start, the thunder king\nhas hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance —\nhis trustiest weapon women’s twisted wiles.\nWhat armies of us died for the sake of Helen . . .\nClytemnestra schemed your death while you were worlds away!’\n‘True, true,’ Agamemnon’s ghost kept pressing on,\n500  ‘so even your own wife —never indulge her too far.\nNever reveal the whole truth, whatever you may know;\njust tell her a part of it, be sure to hide the rest.\nNot that you, Odysseus, will be murdered by your wife.\nShe’s much too steady, her feelings run too deep,\nIcarius’ daughter Penelope, that wise woman.\nShe was a young bride, I well remember . . .\nwe left her behind when we went off to war,\nwith an infant boy she nestled at her breast.\nThat boy must sit and be counted with the men now —\n510  happy man! His beloved father will come sailing home\nand see his son, and he will embrace his father,\nthat is only right. But my wife —she never\neven let me feast my eyes on my own son;\nshe killed me first, his father!\nI tell you this —bear it in mind, you must —\nwhen you reach your homeland steer your ship\ninto port in secret, never out in the open . . .\nthe time for trusting women’s gone forever!\nEnough. Come, tell me this, and be precise.\n520  Have you heard news of my son? Where’s he living now?\nPerhaps in Orchomenos, perhaps in sandy Pylos\nor off in the Spartan plains with Menelaus?\nHe’s not dead yet, my Prince Orestes, no,\nhe’s somewhere on the earth.’\nSo he probed\nbut I cut it short: ‘Atrides, why ask me that?\nI know nothing, whether he’s dead or alive.\nIt’s wrong to lead you on with idle words.’\nSo we stood there, trading heartsick stories,\ndeep in grief, as the tears streamed down our faces.\n530  But now there came the ghosts of Peleus’ son Achilles,\nPatroclus, fearless Antilochus —and Great Ajax too,\nthe first in stature, first in build and bearing\nof all the Argives after Peleus’ matchless son.\nThe ghost of the splendid runner knew me at once\nand hailed me with a flight of mournful questions:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, man of tactics,\nreckless friend, what next?\nWhat greater feat can that cunning head contrive?\nWhat daring brought you down to the House of Death? —\n540  where the senseless, burnt-out wraiths of mortals make their home.’\nThe voice of his spirit paused, and I was quick to answer:\n‘Achilles, son of Peleus, greatest of the Achaeans,\nI had to consult Tiresias, driven here by hopes\nhe would help me journey home to rocky Ithaca.\nNever yet have I neared Achaea, never once\nset foot on native ground . . .\nmy life is endless trouble.\nBut you, Achilles,\nthere’s not a man in the world more blest than you —\nthere never has been, never will be one.\n550  Time was, when you were alive, we Argives\nhonored you as a god, and now down here, I see,\nyou lord it over the dead in all your power.\nSo grieve no more at dying, great Achilles.’\nI reassured the ghost, but he broke out, protesting,\n‘No winning words about death to me, shining Odysseus!\nBy god, I’d rather slave on earth for another man —\nsome dirt-poor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive —\nthan rule down here over all the breathless dead.\nBut come, tell me the news about my gallant son.\nDid he make his way to the wars,\ndid the boy become a champion —yes or no?\nTell me of noble Peleus, any word you’ve heard —\nstill holding pride of place among his Myrmidon hordes,\nor do they despise the man in Hellas and in Phthia\nbecause old age has lamed his arms and legs?\nFor I no longer stand in the light of day —\nthe man I was —comrade-in-arms to help my father\nas once I helped our armies, killing the best fighters\nTroy could field in the wide world up there . . .\n570  Oh to arrive at father’s house —the man I was,\nfor one brief day —I’d make my fury and my hands,\ninvincible hands, a thing of terror to all those men\nwho abuse the king with force and wrest away his honor!’\nSo he grieved but I tried to lend him heart:\n‘About noble Peleus I can tell you nothing,\nbut about your own dear son, Neoptolemus,\nI can report the whole story, as you wish.\nI myself, in my trim ship, I brought him\nout of Scyros to join the Argives under arms.\n580  And dug in around Troy, debating battle-tactics,\nhe always spoke up first, and always on the mark —\ngodlike Nestor and I alone excelled the boy. Yes,\nand when our armies fought on the plain of Troy\nhe’d never hang back with the main force of men —\nhe’d always charge ahead,\ngiving ground to no one in his fury,\nand scores of men he killed in bloody combat.\nHow could I list them all, name them all, now,\nthe fighting ranks he leveled, battling for the Argives?\n590  But what a soldier he laid low with a bronze sword:\nthe hero Eurypylus, Telephus’ son, and round him\ntroops of his own Cetean comrades slaughtered,\nlured to war by the bribe his mother took.\nThe only man I saw to put Eurypylus\nin the shade was Memnon, son of the Morning.\nAgain, when our champions climbed inside the horse\nthat Epeus built with labor, and I held full command\nto spring our packed ambush open or keep it sealed,\nall our lords and captains were wiping off their tears,\n600  knees shaking beneath each man —but not your son.\nNever once did I see his glowing skin go pale;\nhe never flicked a tear from his cheeks, no,\nhe kept on begging me there to let him burst\nfrom the horse, kept gripping his hilted sword,\nhis heavy bronze-tipped javelin, keen to loose\nhis fighting fury against the Trojans. Then,\nonce we’d sacked King Priam’s craggy city,\nladen with his fair share and princely prize\nhe boarded his own ship, his body all unscarred.\n610  Not a wound from a flying spear or a sharp sword,\ncut-and-thrust close up —the common marks of war.\nRandom, raging Ares plays no favorites.’\nSo I said and\noff he went, the ghost of the great runner, Aeacus’ grandson\nloping with long strides across the fields of asphodel,\ntriumphant in all I had told him of his son,\nhis gallant, glorious son.\nNow the rest of the ghosts, the dead and gone\ncame swarming up around me —deep in sorrow there,\neach asking about the grief that touched him most.\nOnly the ghost of Great Ajax, son of Telamon,\nkept his distance, blazing with anger at me still\nfor the victory I had won by the ships that time\nI pressed my claim for the arms of Prince Achilles.\nHis queenly mother had set them up as prizes,\nPallas and captive Trojans served as judges.\nWould to god I’d never won such trophies!\nAll for them the earth closed over Ajax,\nthat proud hero Ajax . . .\ngreatest in build, greatest in works of war\n630  of all the Argives after Peleus’ matchless son.\nI cried out to him now, I tried to win him over:\n‘Ajax, son of noble Telamon, still determined,\neven in death, not once to forget that rage\nyou train on me for those accursed arms?\nThe gods set up that prize to plague the Achaeans —\nso great a tower of strength we lost when you went down!\nFor your death we grieved as we did for Achilles’ death —\nwe grieved incessantly, true, and none’s to blame\nbut Zeus, who hated Achaea’s fighting spearmen\n640  so intensely, Zeus sealed your doom.\nCome closer, king, and listen to my story.\nConquer your rage, your blazing, headstrong pride!’\nSo I cried out but Ajax answered not a word.\nHe stalked off toward Erebus, into the dark\nto join the other lost, departed dead.\nYet now, despite his anger,\nhe might have spoken to me, or I to him,\nbut the heart inside me stirred with some desire\nto see the ghosts of others dead and gone.\nAnd I saw Minos there, illustrious son of Zeus,\nfirmly enthroned, holding his golden scepter,\njudging all the dead . . .\nSome on their feet, some seated, all clustering\nround the king of justice, pleading for his verdicts\nreached in the House of Death with its all-embracing gates.\nI next caught sight of Orion, that huge hunter,\nrounding up on the fields of asphodel those wild beasts\nthe man in life cut down on the lonely mountain-slopes,\nbrandishing in his hands the bronze-studded club\nthat time can never shatter.\nI saw Tityus too,\nson of the mighty goddess Earth —sprawling there\non the ground, spread over nine acres —two vultures\nhunched on either side of him, digging into his liver,\nbeaking deep in the blood-sac, and he with his frantic hands\ncould never beat them off, for he had once dragged off\nthe famous consort of Zeus in all her glory,\nLeto, threading her way toward Pytho’s ridge,\nover the lovely dancing-rings of Panopeus.\nAnd I saw Tantalus too, bearing endless torture.\n670  He stood erect in a pool as the water lapped his chin —\nparched, he tried to drink, but he could not reach the surface,\nno, time and again the old man stooped, craving a sip,\ntime and again the water vanished, swallowed down,\nlaying bare the caked black earth at his feet —\nsome spirit drank it dry. And over his head\nleafy trees dangled their fruit from high aloft,\npomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red,\nsucculent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark,\nbut as soon as the old man would strain to clutch them fast\n680  a gust would toss them up to the lowering dark clouds.\nAnd I saw Sisyphus too, bound to his own torture,\ngrappling his monstrous boulder with both arms working,\nheaving, hands struggling, legs driving, he kept on\nthrusting the rock uphill toward the brink, but just\nas it teetered, set to topple over —\ntime and again\nthe immense weight of the thing would wheel it back and\nthe ruthless boulder would bound and tumble down to the plain again —\nso once again he would heave, would struggle to thrust it up,\nsweat drenching his body, dust swirling above his head.\nAnd next I caught a glimpse of powerful Heracles —\nhis ghost, I mean: the man himself delights\nin the grand feasts of the deathless gods on high,\nwed to Hebe, famed for her lithe, alluring ankles,\nthe daughter of mighty Zeus and Hera shod in gold.\nAround him cries of the dead rang out like cries of birds,\nscattering left and right in horror as on he came like night,\nnaked bow in his grip, an arrow grooved on the bowstring,\nglaring round him fiercely, forever poised to shoot.\nA terror too, that sword-belt sweeping across his chest,\n700  a baldric of solid gold emblazoned with awesome work . . .\nbears and ramping boars and lions with wild, fiery eyes,\nand wars, routs and battles, massacres, butchered men.\nMay the craftsman who forged that masterpiece —\nwhose skills could conjure up a belt like that —\nnever forge another!\nHeracles knew me at once, at first glance,\nand hailed me with a winging burst of pity:\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus famed for exploits,\nluckless man, you too? Braving out a fate as harsh\n710  as the fate I bore, alive in the light of day?\nSon of Zeus that I was, my torments never ended,\nforced to slave for a man not half the man I was:\nhe saddled me with the worst heartbreaking labors.\nWhy, he sent me down here once, to retrieve the hound\nthat guards the dead —no harder task for me, he thought —\nbut I dragged the great beast up from the underworld to earth\nand Hermes and gleaming-eyed Athena blazed the way!’\nWith that he turned and back he went to the House of Death\nbut I held fast in place, hoping that others might still come,\n720  shades of famous heroes, men who died in the old days\nand ghosts of an even older age I longed to see,\nTheseus and Pirithous, the gods’ own radiant sons.\nBut before I could, the dead came surging round me,\nhordes of them, thousands raising unearthly cries,\nand blanching terror gripped me —panicked now\nthat Queen Persephone might send up from Death\nsome monstrous head, some Gorgon’s staring face!\nI rushed back to my ship, commanded all hands\nto take to the decks and cast off cables quickly.\nThey swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks\n730  and a strong tide of the Ocean River swept her on downstream,\nsped by our rowing first, then by a fresh fair wind.”"

    "text": "“Now when our ship had left the Ocean River rolling in her wake\nand launched out into open sea with its long swells to reach\nthe island of Aeaea —east where the Dawn forever young\nhas home and dancing-rings and the Sun his risings —\nheading in we beached our craft on the sands,\nthe crews swung out on the low sloping shore\nand there we fell asleep, awaiting Dawn’s first light.\nAs soon as Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone again\nI dispatched some men to Circe’s halls to bring\n10  the dead Elpenor’s body. We cut logs in haste\nand out on the island’s sharpest jutting headland\nheld his funeral rites in sorrow, streaming tears.\nOnce we’d burned the dead man and the dead man’s armor,\nheaping his grave-mound, hauling a stone that coped it well,\nwe planted his balanced oar aloft to crown his tomb.\nAnd so we saw to his rites, each step in turn.\nNor did our coming back from Death escape Circe —\nshe hurried toward us, decked in rich regalia,\nhandmaids following close with trays of bread\n20  and meats galore and glinting ruddy wine.\nAnd the lustrous goddess, standing in our midst,\nhailed us warmly: ‘Ah my daring, reckless friends!\nYou who ventured down to the House of Death alive,\ndoomed to die twice over —others die just once.\nCome, take some food and drink some wine,\nrest here the livelong day\nand then, tomorrow at daybreak, you must sail.\nBut I will set you a course and chart each seamark,\nso neither on sea nor land will some new trap\n30  ensnare you in trouble, make you suffer more.’\nHer foresight won our fighting spirits over.\nSo all that day till the sun went down we sat\nand feasted on sides of meat and heady wine,\nand then when the sun had set and night came on\nthe men lay down to sleep by the ship’s stern-cables.\nBut Circe, taking me by the hand, drew me away\nfrom all my shipmates there and sat me down\nand lying beside me probed me for details.\nI told her the whole story, start to finish,\n40  then the queenly goddess laid my course:\n‘Your descent to the dead is over, true,\nbut listen closely to what I tell you now\nand god himself will bring it back to mind.\nFirst you will raise the island of the Sirens,\nthose creatures who spellbind any man alive,\nwhoever comes their way. Whoever draws too close,\noff guard, and catches the Sirens’ voices in the air —\nno sailing home for him, no wife rising to meet him,\nno happy children beaming up at their father’s face.\n50  The high, thrilling song of the Sirens will transfix him,\nlolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses\nrotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones . . .\nRace straight past that coast! Soften some beeswax\nand stop your shipmates’ ears so none can hear,\nnone of the crew, but if you are bent on hearing,\nhave them tie you hand and foot in the swift ship,\nerect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast\nso you can hear the Sirens’ song to your heart’s content.\nBut if you plead, commanding your men to set you free,\n60  then they must lash you faster, rope on rope.\nBut once your crew has rowed you past the Sirens\na choice of routes is yours. I cannot advise you\nwhich to take, or lead you through it all —\nyou must decide for yourself —\nbut I can tell you the ways of either course.\nOn one side beetling cliffs shoot up, and against them\npound the huge roaring breakers of blue-eyed Amphitrite —\nthe Clashing Rocks they’re called by all the blissful gods.\nNot even birds can escape them, no, not even the doves\n70  that veer and fly ambrosia home to Father Zeus:\neven of those the sheer Rocks always pick off one\nand Father wings one more to keep the number up.\nNo ship of men has ever approached and slipped past —\nalways some disaster —big timbers and sailors’ corpses\nwhirled away by the waves and lethal blasts of fire.\nOne ship alone, one deep-sea craft sailed clear,\nthe Argo, sung by the world, when heading home\nfrom Aeetes’ shores. And she would have crashed\nagainst those giant rocks and sunk at once if Hera,\nfor love of Jason, had not sped her through.\nOn the other side loom two enormous crags . . .\nOne thrusts into the vaulting sky its jagged peak,\nhooded round with a dark cloud that never leaves —\nno clear bright air can ever bathe its crown,\nnot even in summer’s heat or harvest-time.\nNo man on earth could scale it, mount its crest,\nnot even with twenty hands and twenty feet for climbing,\nthe rock’s so smooth, like dressed and burnished stone.\nAnd halfway up that cliffside stands a fog-bound cavern\n90  gaping west toward Erebus, realm of death and darkness —\npast it, great Odysseus, you should steer your ship.\nNo rugged young archer could hit that yawning cave\nwith a winged arrow shot from off the decks.\nScylla lurks inside it —the yelping horror,\nyelping, no louder than any suckling pup\nbut she’s a grisly monster, I assure you.\nNo one could look on her with any joy,\nnot even a god who meets her face-to-face . . .\nShe has twelve legs, all writhing, dangling down\n100  and six long swaying necks, a hideous head on each,\neach head barbed with a triple row of fangs, thickset,\npacked tight —and armed to the hilt with black death!\nHoled up in the cavern’s bowels from her waist down\nshe shoots out her heads, out of that terrifying pit,\nangling right from her nest, wildly sweeping the reefs\nfor dolphins, dogfish or any bigger quarry she can drag\nfrom the thousands Amphitrite spawns in groaning seas.\nNo mariners yet can boast they’ve raced their ship\npast Scylla’s lair without some mortal blow —\n110  with each of her six heads she snatches up\na man from the dark-prowed craft and whisks him off.\nThe other crag is lower —you will see, Odysseus —\nthough both lie side-by-side, an arrow-shot apart.\nAtop it a great fig-tree rises, shaggy with leaves,\nbeneath it awesome Charybdis gulps the dark water down.\nThree times a day she vomits it up, three times she gulps it down,\nthat terror! Don’t be there when the whirlpool swallows down —\nnot even the earthquake god could save you from disaster.\nNo, hug Scylla’s crag —sail on past her —top speed!\n120  Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship\nthan lose your entire crew.’\nbut tell me the truth now, goddess,’ I protested.\n‘Deadly Charybdis —can’t I possibly cut and run from her\nand still fight Scylla off when Scylla strikes my men?’\n‘So stubborn!’ the lovely goddess countered.\n‘Hell-bent yet again on battle and feats of arms?\nCan’t you bow to the deathless gods themselves?\nScylla’s no mortal, she’s an immortal devastation,\nterrible, savage, wild, no fighting her, no defense —\n130  just flee the creature, that’s the only way.\nWaste any time, arming for battle beside her rock,\nI fear she’ll lunge out again with all of her six heads\nand seize as many men. No, row for your lives,\ninvoke Brute Force, I tell you, Scylla’s mother —\nshe spawned her to scourge mankind,\nshe can stop the monster’s next attack!\nThen you will make the island of Thrinacia . . .\nwhere herds of the Sungod’s cattle graze, and fat sheep\nand seven herds of oxen, as many sheepflocks, rich and woolly,\n140  fifty head in each. No breeding swells their number,\nnor do they ever die. And goddesses herd them on,\nnymphs with glinting hair, Phaëthousa, Lampetie,\nborn to the Sungod Helios by radiant Neaera.\nTheir queenly mother bred and reared them both\nthen settled them on the island of Thrinacia —\ntheir homeland seas away —\nto guard their father’s sheep and longhorn cattle.\nLeave the beasts unharmed, your mind set on home,\nand you all may still reach Ithaca —bent with hardship,\n150  true —but harm them in any way, and I can see it now:\nyour ship destroyed, your men destroyed as well!\nAnd even if you escape, you’ll come home late,\nall shipmates lost, and come a broken man.’\nAt those words Dawn rose on her golden throne\nand lustrous Circe made her way back up the island.\nI went straight to my ship, commanding all hands\nto take to the decks and cast off cables quickly.\nThey swung aboard at once, they sat to the oars in ranks\nand in rhythm churned the water white with stroke on stroke.\n160  And Circe the nymph with glossy braids, the awesome one\nwho speaks with human voice, sent us a hardy shipmate,\nyes, a fresh following wind ruffling up in our wake,\nbellying out our sail to drive our blue prow on as we,\nsecuring the running gear from stem to stern, sat back\nwhile the wind and helmsman kept her true on course.\nAt last, and sore at heart, I told my shipmates,\n‘Friends . . . it’s wrong for only one or two\nto know the revelations that lovely Circe\nmade to me alone. I’ll tell you all,\n170  so we can die with our eyes wide open now\nor escape our fate and certain death together.\nFirst, she warns, we must steer clear of the Sirens,\ntheir enchanting song, their meadow starred with flowers.\nI alone was to hear their voices, so she said,\nbut you must bind me with tight chafing ropes\nso I cannot move a muscle, bound to the spot,\nerect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast.\nAnd if I plead, commanding you to set me free,\nthen lash me faster, rope on pressing rope.’\n180    So I informed my shipmates point by point,\nall the while our trim ship was speeding toward\nthe Sirens’ island, driven on by the brisk wind.\nBut then —the wind fell in an instant,\nall glazed to a dead calm . . .\na mysterious power hushed the heaving swells.\nThe oarsmen leapt to their feet, struck the sail,\nstowed it deep in the hold and sat to the oarlocks,\nthrashing with polished oars, frothing the water white.\nNow with a sharp sword I sliced an ample wheel of beeswax\n190  down into pieces, kneaded them in my two strong hands\nand the wax soon grew soft, worked by my strength\nand Helios’ burning rays, the sun at high noon,\nand I stopped the ears of my comrades one by one.\nThey bound me hand and foot in the tight ship —\nerect at the mast-block, lashed by ropes to the mast —\nand rowed and churned the whitecaps stroke on stroke.\nWe were just offshore as far as a man’s shout can carry,\nscudding close, when the Sirens sensed at once a ship\nwas racing past and burst into their high, thrilling song:\n‘Come closer, famous Odysseus —Achaea’s pride and glory —\nmoor your ship on our coast so you can hear our song!\nNever has any sailor passed our shores in his black craft\nuntil he has heard the honeyed voices pouring from our lips,\nand once he hears to his heart’s content sails on, a wiser man.\nWe know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once endured\non the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so —\nall that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!’\nSo they sent their ravishing voices out across the air\nand the heart inside me throbbed to listen longer.\n210  I signaled the crew with frowns to set me free —\nthey flung themselves at the oars and rowed on harder,\nPerimedes and Eurylochus springing up at once\nto bind me faster with rope on chafing rope.\nBut once we’d left the Sirens fading in our wake,\nonce we could hear their song no more, their urgent call —\nmy steadfast crew was quick to remove the wax I’d used\nto seal their ears and loosed the bonds that lashed me.\nWe’d scarcely put that island astern when suddenly\nI saw smoke and heavy breakers, heard their booming thunder.\n220  The men were terrified —oarblades flew from their grip,\nclattering down to splash in the vessel’s wash.\nShe lay there, dead in the water . . .\nno hands to tug the blades that drove her on.\nBut I strode down the decks to rouse my crewmen,\nhalting beside each one with a bracing, winning word:\n‘Friends, we’re hardly strangers at meeting danger —\nand this danger is no worse than what we faced\nwhen Cyclops penned us up in his vaulted cave\nwith crushing force! But even from there my courage,\n230  my presence of mind and tactics saved us all,\nand we will live to remember this someday,\nI have no doubt. Up now, follow my orders,\nall of us work as one! You men at the thwarts —\nlay on with your oars and strike the heaving swells,\ntrusting that Zeus will pull us through these straits alive.\nYou, helmsman, here’s your order —burn it in your mind —\nthe steering-oar of our rolling ship is in your hands.\nKeep her clear of that smoke and surging breakers,\nhead for those crags or she’ll catch you off guard,\n240  she’ll yaw over there —you’ll plunge us all in ruin!’\nSo I shouted. They snapped to each command.\nNo mention of Scylla —how to fight that nightmare? —\nfor fear the men would panic, desert their oars\nand huddle down and stow themselves away.\nBut now I cleared my mind of Circe’s orders —\ncramping my style, urging me not to arm at all.\nI donned my heroic armor, seized long spears\nin both my hands and marched out on the half-deck,\nforward, hoping from there to catch the first glimpse\n250  of Scylla, ghoul of the cliffs, swooping to kill my men.\nBut nowhere could I make her out —and my eyes ached,\nscanning that mist-bound rock face top to bottom.\nNow wailing in fear, we rowed on up those straits,\nScylla to starboard, dreaded Charybdis off to port,\nher horrible whirlpool gulping the sea-surge down, down\nbut when she spewed it up —like a cauldron over a raging fire —\nall her churning depths would seethe and heave —exploding spray\nshowering down to splatter the peaks of both crags at once!\nBut when she swallowed the sea-surge down her gaping maw\n260  the whole abyss lay bare and the rocks around her roared,\nterrible, deafening —\nbedrock showed down deep, boiling\nblack with sand —\nand ashen terror gripped the men.\nBut now, fearing death, all eyes fixed on Charybdis —\nnow Scylla snatched six men from our hollow ship,\nthe toughest, strongest hands I had, and glancing\nbackward over the decks, searching for my crew\nI could see their hands and feet already hoisted,\nflailing, high, higher, over my head, look —\nwailing down at me, comrades riven in agony,\n270  shrieking out my name for one last time!\nJust as an angler poised on a jutting rock\nflings his treacherous bait in the offshore swell,\nwhips his long rod —hook sheathed in an oxhorn lure —\nand whisks up little fish he flips on the beach-break,\nwrithing, gasping out their lives . . . so now they writhed,\ngasping as Scylla swung them up her cliff and there\nat her cavern’s mouth she bolted them down raw —\nscreaming out, flinging their arms toward me,\nlost in that mortal struggle . . .\n280  Of all the pitiful things I’ve had to witness,\nsuffering, searching out the pathways of the sea,\nthis wrenched my heart the most.\nBut now, at last,\nputting the Rocks, Scylla and dread Charybdis far astern,\nwe quickly reached the good green island of the Sun\nwhere Helios, lord Hyperion, keeps his fine cattle,\nbroad in the brow, and flocks of purebred sheep.\nStill aboard my black ship in the open sea\nI could hear the lowing cattle driven home,\nthe bleating sheep. And I was struck once more\n290  by the words of the blind Theban prophet, Tiresias,\nand Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me\nto shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man.\nSo I warned my shipmates gravely, sick at heart,\n‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship,\nlet me tell you the dire prophecies of Tiresias\nand Aeaean Circe too: time and again they told me\nto shun this island of the Sun, the joy of man.\nHere, they warned, the worst disaster awaits us.\nRow straight past these shores —race our black ship on!’\n300    So I said, and the warnings broke their hearts.\nBut Eurylochus waded in at once —with mutiny on his mind:\n‘You’re a hard man, Odysseus. Your fighting spirit’s\nstronger than ours, your stamina never fails.\nYou must be made of iron head to foot. Look,\nyour crew’s half-dead with labor, starved for sleep,\nand you forbid us to set foot on land, this island here,\nwashed by the waves, where we might catch a decent meal again.\nDrained as we are, night falling fast, you’d have us desert\nthis haven and blunder off, into the mist-bound seas?\n310  Out of the night come winds that shatter vessels —\nhow can a man escape his headlong death\nif suddenly, out of nowhere, a cyclone hits,\nbred by the South or stormy West Wind? They’re the gales\nthat tear a ship to splinters —the gods, our masters,\nwilling or not, it seems. No, let’s give way\nto the dark night, set out our supper here.\nSit tight by our swift ship and then at daybreak\nboard and launch her, make for open sea!’\nSo Eurylochus urged, and shipmates cheered.\n320  Then I knew some power was brewing trouble for us,\nso I let fly with an anxious plea: ‘Eurylochus,\nI’m one against all —the upper hand is yours.\nBut swear me a binding oath, all here, that if\nwe come on a herd of cattle or fine flock of sheep,\nnot one man among us —blind in his reckless ways —\nwill slaughter an ox or ram. Just eat in peace,\ncontent with the food immortal Circe gave us.’\nThey quickly swore the oath that I required\nand once they had vowed they’d never harm the herds,\n330  they moored our sturdy ship in the deep narrow harbor,\nclose to a fresh spring, and all hands disembarked\nand adeptly set about the evening meal.\nOnce they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nthey recalled our dear companions, wept for the men\nthat Scylla plucked from the hollow ship and ate alive,\nand a welcome sleep came on them in their tears.\nat the night’s third watch, the stars just wheeling down,\nZeus who marshals the stormclouds loosed a ripping wind,\na howling, demonic gale, shrouding over in thunderheads\n340  the earth and sea at once —and night swept down from the sky.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nwe hauled our craft ashore, securing her in a vaulted cave\nwhere nymphs have lovely dancing-rings and hold their sessions.\nThere I called a muster, warning my shipmates yet again,\n‘Friends, we’ve food and drink aplenty aboard the ship —\nkeep your hands off all these herds or we will pay the price!\nThe cattle, the sleek flocks, belong to an awesome master,\nHelios, god of the sun who sees all, hears all things.’\nSo I warned, and my headstrong men complied.\n350  But for one whole month the South Wind blew nonstop,\nno other wind came up, none but the South, Southeast.\nAs long as our food and ruddy wine held out, the crew,\neager to save their lives, kept hands off the herds.\nBut then, when supplies aboard had all run dry,\nwhen the men turned to hunting, forced to range\nfor quarry with twisted hooks: for fish, birds,\nanything they could lay their hands on —\nhunger racked their bellies —I struck inland,\nup the island, there to pray to the gods.\n360  If only one might show me some way home!\nCrossing into the heartland, clear of the crew,\nI rinsed my hands in a sheltered spot, a windbreak,\nbut soon as I’d prayed to all the gods who rule Olympus,\ndown on my eyes they poured a sweet, sound sleep . . .\nas Eurylochus opened up his fatal plan to friends:\n‘Listen to me, my comrades, brothers in hardship.\nAll ways of dying are hateful to us poor mortals,\ntrue, but to die of hunger, starve to death —\nthat’s the worst of all. So up with you now,\n370  let’s drive off the pick of Helios’ sleek herds,\nslaughter them to the gods who rule the skies up there.\nIf we ever make it home to Ithaca, native ground,\nerect at once a glorious temple to the Sungod,\nline the walls with hoards of dazzling gifts!\nBut if the Sun, inflamed for his longhorn cattle,\nmeans to wreck our ship and the other gods pitch in —\nI’d rather die at sea, with one deep gulp of death,\nthan die by inches on this desolate island here!’\nSo he urged, and shipmates cheered again.\n380  At once they drove off the Sungod’s finest cattle —\nclose at hand, not far from the blue-prowed ship they grazed,\nthose splendid beasts with their broad brows and curving horns.\nSurrounding them in a ring, they lifted prayers to the gods,\nplucking fresh green leaves from a tall oak for the rite,\nsince white strewing-barley was long gone in the ship.\nOnce they’d prayed, slaughtered and skinned the cattle,\nthey cut the thighbones out, they wrapped them round in fat,\na double fold sliced clean and topped with strips of flesh.\nAnd since they had no wine to anoint the glowing victims,\n390  they made libations with water, broiling all the innards,\nand once they’d burned the bones and tasted the organs —\nhacked the rest into pieces, piercing them with spits.\nThat moment soothing slumber fell from my eyes\nand down I went to our ship at the water’s edge\nbut on my way, nearing the long beaked craft,\nthe smoky savor of roasts came floating up around me . . .\nI groaned in anguish, crying out to the deathless gods:\n‘Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die —\nyou with your fatal sleep, you lulled me into disaster.\n400  Left on their own, look what a monstrous thing\nmy crew concocted!’\nQuick as a flash\nwith her flaring robes Lampetie sped the news\nto the Sun on high that we had killed his herds\nand Helios burst out in rage to all the immortals:\n‘Father Zeus! the rest of you blissful gods who never die —\npunish them all, that crew of Laertes’ son Odysseus —\nwhat an outrage! They, they killed my cattle,\nthe great joy of my heart . . . day in, day out,\nwhen I climbed the starry skies and when I wheeled\n410  back down from the heights to touch the earth once more.\nUnless they pay me back in blood for the butchery of my herds,\ndown I go to the House of Death and blaze among the dead!’\nBut Zeus who marshals the thunderheads insisted,\n‘Sun, you keep on shining among the deathless gods\nand mortal men across the good green earth.\nAnd as for the guilty ones, why, soon enough\non the wine-dark sea I’ll hit their racing ship\nwith a white-hot bolt, I’ll tear it into splinters.’\n—Or so I heard from the lovely nymph Calypso,\n420  who heard it herself, she said, from Hermes, god of guides.\nAs soon as I reached our ship at the water’s edge\nI took the men to task, upbraiding each in turn,\nbut how to set things right? We couldn’t find a way.\nThe cattle were dead already . . .\nand the gods soon showed us all some fateful signs —\nthe hides began to crawl, the meat, both raw and roasted,\nbellowed out on the spits, and we heard a noise\nlike the moan of lowing oxen.\nYet six more days\nmy eager companions feasted on the cattle of the Sun,\n430  the pick of the herds they’d driven off, but then,\nwhen Cronian Zeus brought on the seventh day,\nthe wind in its ceaseless raging dropped at last,\nand stepping the mast at once, hoisting the white sail\nwe boarded ship and launched her, made for open sea.\nBut once we’d left that island in our wake —\nno land at all in sight, nothing but sea and sky —\nthen Zeus the son of Cronus mounted a thunderhead\nabove our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it.\nNor did the craft scud on much longer. All of a sudden\n440  killer-squalls attacked us, screaming out of the west,\na murderous blast shearing the two forestays off\nso the mast toppled backward, its running tackle spilling\ninto the bilge. The mast itself went crashing into the stern,\nit struck the helmsman’s head and crushed his skull to pulp\nand down from his deck the man flipped like a diver —\nhis hardy life spirit left his bones behind.\nThen, then in the same breath Zeus hit the craft\nwith a lightning-bolt and thunder. Round she spun,\nreeling under the impact, filled with reeking brimstone,\n450  shipmates pitching out of her, bobbing round like seahawks\nswept along by the whitecaps past the trim black hull —\nand the god cut short their journey home forever.\nBut I went lurching along our battered hulk\ntill the sea-surge ripped the plankings from the keel\nand the waves swirled it away, stripped bare, and snapped\nthe mast from the decks —but a backstay made of bull’s-hide\nstill held fast, and with this I lashed the mast and keel\ntogether, made them one, riding my makeshift raft\nas the wretched galewinds bore me on and on.\n460    At last the West Wind quit its wild rage\nbut the South came on at once to hound me even more,\nmaking me double back my route toward cruel Charybdis.\nAll night long I was rushed back and then at break of day\nI reached the crag of Scylla and dire Charybdis’ vortex\nright when the dreadful whirlpool gulped the salt sea down.\nBut heaving myself aloft to clutch at the fig-tree’s height,\nlike a bat I clung to its trunk for dear life —not a chance\nfor a good firm foothold there, no clambering up it either,\nthe roots too far to reach, the boughs too high overhead,\n470  huge swaying branches that overshadowed Charybdis.\nBut I held on, dead set . . . waiting for her\nto vomit my mast and keel back up again —\nOh how I ached for both! and back they came,\nlate but at last, at just the hour a judge at court,\nwho’s settled the countless suits of brash young claimants,\nrises, the day’s work done, and turns home for supper —\nthat’s when the timbers reared back up from Charybdis.\nI let go —I plunged with my hands and feet flailing,\ncrashing into the waves beside those great beams\n480  and scrambling aboard them fast\nI rowed hard with my hands right through the straits . . .\nAnd the father of men and gods did not let Scylla see me,\nelse I’d have died on the spot —no escape from death.\nI drifted along nine days. On the tenth, at night,\nthe gods cast me up on Ogygia, Calypso’s island,\nhome of the dangerous nymph with glossy braids\nwho speaks with human voice, and she took me in,\nshe loved me . . . Why cover the same ground again?\nJust yesterday, here at hall, I told you all the rest,\n490  you and your gracious wife. It goes against my grain\nto repeat a tale told once, and told so clearly.”"

    "text": "His tale was over now. The Phaeacians all fell silent, hushed,\nhis story holding them spellbound down the shadowed halls\nuntil Alcinous found the poise to say, “Odysseus,\nnow that you have come to my bronze-floored house,\nmy vaulted roofs, I know you won’t be driven\noff your course, nothing can hold you back —\nhowever much you’ve suffered, you’ll sail home.\nHere, friends, here’s a command for one and all,\nyou who frequent my palace day and night and drink\n10  the shining wine of kings and enjoy the harper’s songs.\nThe robes and hammered gold and a haul of other gifts\nyou lords of our island council brought our guest —\nall lie packed in his polished sea-chest now. Come,\neach of us add a sumptuous tripod, add a cauldron!\nThen recover our costs with levies on the people:\nit’s hard to afford such bounty man by man.”\nThe king’s instructions met with warm applause\nand home they went to sleep, each in his own house.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\n20  they hurried down to the ship with handsome bronze gifts,\nand striding along the decks, the ardent King Alcinous\nstowed them under the benches, shipshape, so nothing\ncould foul the crewmen tugging at their oars.\nThen back the party went to Alcinous’ house\nand shared a royal feast.\nThe majestic king\nslaughtered an ox for them to Cronus’ mighty son,\nZeus of the thundercloud, whose power rules the world.\nThey burned the thighs and fell to the lordly banquet,\nreveling there, while in their midst the inspired bard\n30  struck up a song, Demodocus, prized by all the people.\nTrue, but time and again Odysseus turned his face\ntoward the radiant sun, anxious for it to set,\nyearning now to be gone and home once more . . .\nAs a man aches for his evening meal when all day long\nhis brace of wine-dark oxen have dragged the bolted plowshare\ndown a fallow field —how welcome the setting sun to him,\nthe going home to supper, yes, though his knees buckle,\nstruggling home at last. So welcome now to Odysseus\nthe setting light of day, and he lost no time\n40  as he pressed Phaeacia’s men who love their oars,\naddressing his host, Alcinous, first and foremost:\n“Alcinous, majesty, shining among your island people,\nmake your libations, launch me safely on my way —\nto one and all, farewell!\nAll is now made good, my heart’s desire,\nyour convoy home, your precious, loving gifts,\nand may the gods of Olympus bless them for me!\nMay I find an unswerving wife when I reach home,\nand loved ones hale, unharmed! And you, my friends\n50  remaining here in your kingdom now, may you delight\nin your loyal wives and children! May the gods\nrain down all kinds of fortune on your lives,\nmisfortune never harbor in your homeland!”\nAll burst into applause, urging passage home\nfor their parting guest, his farewell rang so true.\nHallowed King Alcinous briskly called his herald:\n“Come, Pontonous! Mix the wine in the bowl,\npour rounds to all our banqueters in the house,\nso we, with a prayer to mighty Zeus the Father,\n60  can sail our new friend home to native land.”\nPontonous mixed the heady, honeyed wine\nand hovering closely, poured full rounds for all.\nAnd from where they sat they tipped libations out\nto the happy gods who rule the vaulting skies.\nThen King Odysseus rose up from his seat\nand placing his two-eared cup in Arete’s hands,\naddressed the queen with parting wishes on the wing:\n“Your health, my queen, through all your days to come —\nuntil old age and death, that visit all mankind,\n70  pay you a visit too. Now I am on my way\nbut you, may you take joy in this house of yours,\nin your children, your people, in Alcinous the king!”\nWith that the great Odysseus strode across the threshold.\nAnd King Alcinous sent the herald off with the guest\nto lead him down to the swift ship and foaming surf.\nAnd Arete sent her serving-women, one to carry\na sea-cloak, washed and fresh, a shirt as well,\nanother assigned to bear the sturdy chest\nand a third to take the bread and ruddy wine.\n80    When they reached the ship at the water’s edge\nthe royal escorts took charge of the gifts at once\nand stores of food and wine, stowed them deep in the holds,\nand then for their guest they spread out rug and sheets\non the half-deck, clear astern on the ship’s hull\nso he might sleep there soundly, undisturbed.\nAnd last, Odysseus climbed aboard himself\nand down he lay, all quiet\nas crewmen sat to the oarlocks, each in line.\nThey slipped the cable free of the drilled stone post\n90  and soon as they swung back and the blades tossed up the spray\nan irresistible sleep fell deeply on his eyes, the sweetest,\nsoundest oblivion, still as the sleep of death itself . . .\nAnd the ship like a four-horse team careering down the plain,\nall breaking as one with the whiplash cracking smartly,\nleaping with hoofs high to run the course in no time —\nso the stern hove high and plunged with the seething rollers\ncrashing dark in her wake as on she surged unwavering,\nnever flagging, no, not even a darting hawk,\nthe quickest thing on wings, could keep her pace\n100  as on she ran, cutting the swells at top speed,\nbearing a man endowed with the gods’ own wisdom,\none who had suffered twenty years of torment, sick at heart,\ncleaving his way through wars of men and pounding waves at sea\nbut now he slept in peace, the memory of his struggles\nlaid to rest.\nAnd then, that hour the star rose up,\nthe clearest, brightest star, that always heralds\nthe newborn light of day, the deep-sea-going ship\nmade landfall on the island . . . Ithaca, at last.\nThere on the coast a haven lies, named for Phorcys,\n110  the old god of the deep —with two jutting headlands,\nsheared off at the seaward side but shelving toward the bay,\nthat break the great waves whipped by the gales outside\nso within the harbor ships can ride unmoored\nwhenever they come in mooring range of shore.\nAt the harbor’s head a branching olive stands\nwith a welcome cave nearby it, dank with sea-mist,\nsacred to nymphs of the springs we call the Naiads.\nThere are mixing-bowls inside and double-handled jars,\ncrafted of stone, and bees store up their honey in the hollows.\n120  There are long stone looms as well, where the nymphs weave out\ntheir webs from clouds of sea-blue wool —a marvelous sight —\nand a wellspring flows forever. The cave has two ways in,\none facing the North Wind, a pathway down for mortals;\nthe other, facing the South, belongs to the gods,\nno man may go that way . . .\nit is the path for all the deathless powers.\nHere at this bay the Phaeacian crew put in —\nthey’d known it long before —driving the ship so hard\nshe ran up onto the beach for a good half her length,\n130  such way the oarsmen’s brawny arms had made.\nUp from the benches, swinging down to land,\nfirst they lifted Odysseus off the decks —\nlinen and lustrous carpet too —and laid him\ndown on the sand asleep, still dead to the world,\nthen hoisted out the treasures proud Phaeacians,\nurged by open-hearted Pallas, had lavished on him,\nsetting out for home. They heaped them all\nby the olive’s trunk, in a neat pile, clear\nof the road for fear some passerby might spot\n140  and steal Odysseus’ hoard before he could awaken.\nThen pushing off, they pulled for home themselves.\nBut now Poseidon, god of the earthquake, never once\nforgetting the first threats he leveled at the hero,\nprobed almighty Zeus to learn his plans in full:\n“Zeus, Father, I will lose all my honor now\namong the immortals, now there are mortal men\nwho show me no respect —Phaeacians, too,\nborn of my own loins! I said myself\nthat Odysseus would suffer long and hard\n150  before he made it home, but I never dreamed\nof blocking his return, not absolutely at least,\nonce you had pledged your word and bowed your head.\nBut now they’ve swept him across the sea in their swift ship,\nthey’ve set him down in Ithaca, sound asleep, and loaded the man\nwith boundless gifts —bronze and hoards of gold and robes —\naye, more plunder than he could ever have won from Troy\nif Odysseus had returned intact with his fair share!”\n“Incredible,” Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied.\n“Earth-shaker, you with your massive power, why moaning so?\n160  The gods don’t disrespect you. What a stir there’d be\nif they flung abuse at the oldest, noblest of them all.\nThose mortals? If any man, so lost in his strength\nand prowess, pays you no respect —just pay him back.\nThe power is always yours.\nDo what you like. Whatever warms your heart.”\n“King of the dark cloud,” the earthquake god agreed,\n“I’d like to avenge myself at once, as you advise,\nbut I’ve always feared your wrath and shied away.\nBut now I’ll crush that fine Phaeacian cutter\n170  out on the misty sea, now on her homeward run\nfrom the latest convoy. They will learn at last\nto cease and desist from escorting every man alive —\nI’ll pile a huge mountain round about their port!”\n“Wait, dear brother,” Zeus who collects the clouds\nhad second thoughts. “Here’s what seems best to me.\nAs the people all lean down from the city heights\nto watch her speeding home, strike her into a rock\nthat looks like a racing vessel, just offshore —\namaze all men with a marvel for the ages.\nThen pile your huge mountain round about their port.”\nHearing that from Zeus, the god of the earthquake\nsped to Scheria now, the Phaeacians’ island home,\nand waited there till the ship came sweeping in,\nscudding lightly along —and surging close abreast,\nthe earthquake god with one flat stroke of his hand\nstruck her to stone, rooted her to the ocean floor\nand made for open sea.\nThe Phaeacians, aghast,\nthose lords of the long oars, the master mariners\ntraded startled glances, sudden outcries:\n190  “Look —who’s pinned our swift ship to the sea?”\n“Just racing for home!”\n“Just hove into plain view!”\nThey might well wonder, blind to what had happened,\ntill Alcinous rose and made things all too clear:\n“Oh no —my father’s prophecy years ago . . .\nit all comes home to me with a vengeance now!\nHe used to say Poseidon was vexed with us because\nwe escorted all mankind and never came to grief.\nHe said that one day, as a well-built ship of ours\nsailed home on the misty sea from such a convoy,\n200  the god would crush it, yes,\nand pile a huge mountain round about our port.\nSo the old king foretold. Now, look, it all comes true!\nHurry, friends, do as I say, let us all comply:\nstop our convoys home for every castaway\nchancing on our city! As for Poseidon,\nsacrifice twelve bulls to the god at once —\nthe pick of the herds. Perhaps he’ll pity us,\npile no looming mountain ridge around our port.”\nThe people, terrified, prepared the bulls at once.\n210  So all of Phaeacia’s island lords and captains,\nmilling round the altar, lifted prayers\nto Poseidon, master of the sea . . .\nThat very moment\ngreat Odysseus woke from sleep on native ground at last —\nhe’d been away for years —but failed to know the land\nfor the goddess Pallas Athena, Zeus’s daughter,\nshowered mist over all, so under cover\nshe might change his appearance head to foot\nas she told him every peril he’d meet at home —\nkeep him from being known by wife, townsmen, friends,\n220  till the suitors paid the price for all their outrage.\nAnd so to the king himself all Ithaca looked strange . . .\nthe winding beaten paths, the coves where ships can ride,\nthe steep rock face of the cliffs and the tall leafy trees.\nHe sprang to his feet and, scanning his own native country,\ngroaned, slapped his thighs with his flat palms\nand Odysseus cried in anguish:\n“Man of misery, whose land have I lit on now?\nWhat are they here —violent, savage, lawless?\nor friendly to strangers, god-fearing men?\n230  Where can I take this heap of treasure now\nand where in the world do I wander off myself?\nIf only the trove had stayed among the Phaeacians there\nand I had made my way to some other mighty king\nwho would have hosted me well and sent me home!\nBut now I don’t know where to stow all this,\nand I can’t leave it here, inviting any bandit\nto rob me blind.\nSo damn those lords and captains,\nthose Phaeacians! Not entirely honest or upright, were they?\nSweeping me off to this, this no-man’s-land, and they,\n240  they swore they’d sail me home to sunny Ithaca —well,\nthey never kept their word. Zeus of the Suppliants\npay them back —he keeps an eye on the world of men\nand punishes all transgressors!\nCome, quickly,\nI’ll inspect my treasure and count it up myself.\nDid they make off with anything in their ship?”\nWith that he counted up the gorgeous tripods,\ncauldrons, bars of gold and the lovely woven robes.\nNot a stitch was missing from the lot. But still\nhe wept for his native country, trailing down the shore\n250  where the wash of sea on shingle ebbs and flows,\nhis homesick heart in turmoil.\nBut now Athena appeared and came toward him.\nShe looked like a young man . . . a shepherd boy\nyet elegant too, with all the gifts that grace the sons of kings,\nwith a well-cut cloak falling in folds across her shoulders,\nsandals under her shining feet, a hunting spear in hand.\nOdysseus, overjoyed at the sight, went up to meet her,\njoining her now with salutations on the wing:\n“Greetings, friend! Since you are the first\n260  I’ve come on in this harbor, treat me kindly —\nno cruelty, please. Save these treasures,\nsave me too. I pray to you like a god,\nI fall before your knees and ask your mercy!\nAnd tell me this for a fact —I need to know —\nwhere on earth am I? what land? who lives here?\nIs it one of the sunny islands or some jutting shore\nof the good green mainland slanting down to sea?”\nAthena answered, her eyes brightening now,\n“You must be a fool, stranger, or come from nowhere,\n270  if you really have to ask what land this is.\nTrust me, it’s not so nameless after all.\nIt’s known the world around,\nto all who live to the east and rising sun\nand to all who face the western mists and darkness.\nIt’s a rugged land, too cramped for driving horses,\nbut though it’s far from broad, it’s hardly poor.\nThere’s plenty of grain for bread, grapes for wine,\nthe rains never fail and the dewfall’s healthy.\nGood country for goats, good for cattle too —\n280  there’s stand on stand of timber\nand water runs in streambeds through the year.\nstranger, the name of Ithaca’s reached as far as Troy,\nand Troy, they say, is a long hard sail from Greece.”\nIthaca . . . Heart racing, Odysseus that great exile\nfilled with joy to hear Athena, daughter of storming Zeus,\npronounce that name. He stood on native ground at last\nand he replied with a winging word to Pallas,\nnot with a word of truth —he choked it back,\nalways invoking the cunning in his heart:\n290  “Ithaca . . . yes, I seem to have heard of Ithaca,\neven on Crete’s broad island far across the sea,\nand now I’ve reached it myself, with all this loot,\nbut I left behind an equal measure for my children.\nI’m a fugitive now, you see. I killed Idomeneus’ son,\nOrsilochus, lightning on his legs, a man who beat\nall runners alive on that long island —what a racer!\nHe tried to rob me of all the spoil I’d won at Troy,\nthe plunder I went to hell and back to capture, true,\ncleaving my way through wars of men and waves at sea —\n300  and just because I refused to please his father,\nserve under him at Troy. I led my own command.\nSo now with a friend I lay in wait by the road,\nI killed him just loping in from the fields —\nwith one quick stroke of my bronze spear\nin the dead of night, the heavens pitch-black . . .\nno one could see us, spot me tearing out his life\nwith a weapon honed for action. Once I’d cut him down\nI made for a ship and begged the Phoenician crew for mercy,\npaying those decent hands a hearty share of plunder —\n310  asked them to take me on and land me down in Pylos,\nthere or lovely Elis, where Epeans rule in power.\nBut a heavy galewind blew them way off course,\nmuch against their will —\nthey’d no desire to cheat me. Driven afar,\nwe reached this island here at the midnight hour,\nrowing for dear life, we made it into your harbor —\nnot a thought of supper, much as we all craved food,\nwe dropped from the decks and lay down, just like that!\nA welcome sleep came over my weary bones at once,\n320  while the crew hoisted up my loot from the holds\nand set it down on the sand near where I slept.\nThey reembarked, now homeward bound for Sidon,\ntheir own noble city, leaving me here behind,\nhomesick in my heart . . .”\nAs his story ended,\ngoddess Athena, gray eyes gleaming, broke into a smile\nand stroked him with her hand, and now she appeared a woman,\nbeautiful, tall and skilled at weaving lovely things.\nHer words went flying straight toward Odysseus:\n“Any man —any god who met you —would have to be\n330  some champion lying cheat to get past you\nfor all-round craft and guile! You terrible man,\nfoxy, ingenious, never tired of twists and tricks —\nso, not even here, on native soil, would you give up\nthose wily tales that warm the cockles of your heart!\nCome, enough of this now. We’re both old hands\nat the arts of intrigue. Here among mortal men\nyou’re far the best at tactics, spinning yarns,\nand I am famous among the gods for wisdom,\ncunning wiles, too.\n340  Ah, but you never recognized me, did you?\nPallas Athena, daughter of Zeus —who always\nstands beside you, shields you in every exploit:\nthanks to me the Phaeacians all embraced you warmly.\nAnd now I am here once more, to weave a scheme with you\nand to hide the treasure-trove Phaeacia’s nobles\nlavished on you then —I willed it, planned it so\nwhen you set out for home —and to tell you all\nthe trials you must suffer in your palace . . .\nEndure them all. You must. You have no choice.\n350  And to no one —no man, no woman, not a soul —\nreveal that you are the wanderer home at last.\nNo, in silence you must bear a world of pain,\nsubject yourself to the cruel abuse of men.”\n“Ah goddess,” the cool tactician countered,\n“you’re so hard for a mortal man to know on sight,\nhowever shrewd he is —the shapes you take are endless!\nBut I do know this: you were kind to me in the war years,\nso long as we men of Achaea soldiered on at Troy.\nBut once we’d sacked King Priam’s craggy city,\n360  boarded ship, and a god dispersed the fleet,\nfrom then on, daughter of Zeus, I never saw you,\nnever glimpsed you striding along my decks\nto ward off some disaster. No, I wandered on,\nmy heart forever torn to pieces inside my chest\ntill the gods released me from my miseries at last,\nthat day in the fertile kingdom of Phaeacia when\nyou cheered me with words, in person, led me to their city.\nBut now I beg you by your almighty Father’s name . . .\nfor I can’t believe I’ve reached my sunny Ithaca,\n370  I must be roaming around one more exotic land —\nyou’re mocking me, I know it, telling me tales\nto make me lose my way. Tell me the truth now,\nhave I really reached the land I love?”\n“Always the same, your wary turn of mind,”\nAthena exclaimed, her glances flashing warmly.\n“That’s why I can’t forsake you in your troubles —\nyou are so winning, so worldly-wise, so self-possessed!\nAnyone else, come back from wandering long and hard,\nwould have hurried home at once, delighted to see\n380  his children and his wife. Oh, but not you,\nit’s not your pleasure to probe for news of them —\nyou must put your wife to the proof yourself!\nBut she, she waits in your halls, as always,\nher life an endless hardship . . .\nwasting away the nights, weeping away the days.\nI never had doubts myself, no, I knew down deep\nthat you would return at last, with all your shipmates lost.\nBut I could not bring myself to fight my Father’s brother,\nPoseidon, quaking with anger at you, still enraged\n390  because you blinded the Cyclops, his dear son.\nBut come, let me show you Ithaca’s setting,\nI’ll convince you. This haven —look around —\nit’s named for Phorcys, the old god of the deep,\nand here at the harbor’s head the branching olive stands\nwith the welcome cave nearby it, dank with sea-mist,\nsacred to nymphs of the springs we call the Naiads.\nHere, under its arching vault, time and again\nyou’d offer the nymphs a generous sacrifice\nto bring success! And the slopes above you, look,\nMount Neriton decked in forests!”\n400                                       At those words\nthe goddess scattered the mist and the country stood out clear\nand the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last,\nthrilled to see his Ithaca —he kissed the good green earth\nand raised his hands to the nymphs and prayed at once,\n“Nymphs of the springs, Naiads, daughters of Zeus,\nI never dreamed I would see you yet again . . .\nNow rejoice in my loving prayers —and later,\njust like the old days, I will give you gifts\nif Athena, Zeus’s daughter, Queen of Armies\n410  comes to my rescue, grants this fighter life\nand brings my son to manhood!”\n“Courage!” —\ngoddess Athena answered, eyes afire —\n“Free your mind of all that anguish now.\nCome, quick, let’s bury your treasures here\nin some recess of this haunted hallowed cave\nwhere they’ll be safe and sound,\nthen we’ll make plans so we can win the day.”\nthe goddess swept into the cavern’s shadowed vault,\nsearching for hiding-places far inside its depths\n420  while Odysseus hauled his treasures closer up,\nthe gold, durable bronze and finespun robes,\nthe Phaeacians’ parting gifts.\nOnce he’d stowed them well away, the goddess,\nPallas Athena, daughter of storming Zeus,\nsealed the mouth of the cavern with a stone.\nThen down they sat by the sacred olive’s trunk\nto plot the death of the high and mighty suitors.\nThe bright-eyed goddess Athena led the way:\n“Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,\n430  think how to lay your hands on all those brazen suitors,\nlording it over your house now, three whole years,\ncourting your noble wife, offering gifts to win her.\nBut she, forever broken-hearted for your return,\nbuilds up each man’s hopes —\ndangling promises, dropping hints to each —\nbut all the while with something else in mind.”\n“God help me!” the man of intrigue broke out:\n“Clearly I might have died the same ignoble death\nas Agamemnon, bled white in my own house too,\n440  if you had never revealed this to me now,\ngoddess, point by point.\nCome, weave us a scheme so I can pay them back!\nStand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce\nas the day we ripped Troy’s glittering crown of towers down.\nStand by me —furious now as then, my bright-eyed one —\nand I would fight three hundred men, great goddess,\nwith you to brace me, comrade-in-arms in battle!”\nGray eyes ablaze, the goddess urged him on:\n“Surely I’ll stand beside you, not forget you,\n450  not when the day arrives for us to do our work.\nThose men who court your wife and waste your goods?\nI have a feeling some will splatter your ample floors\nwith all their blood and brains. Up now, quickly.\nFirst I will transform you —no one must know you.\nI will shrivel the supple skin on your lithe limbs,\nstrip the russet curls from your head and deck you out\nin rags you’d hate to see some other mortal wear;\nI’ll dim the fire in your eyes, so shining once —\nuntil you seem appalling to all those suitors,\n460  even your wife and son you left behind at home.\nBut you, you make your way to the swineherd first,\nin charge of your pigs, and true to you as always,\nloyal friend to your son, to Penelope, so self-possessed.\nYou’ll find him posted beside his swine, grubbing round\nby Raven’s Rock and the spring called Arethusa,\nrooting for feed that makes pigs sleek and fat,\nthe nuts they love, the dark pools they drink.\nWait there, sit with him, ask him all he knows.\nI’m off to Sparta, where the women are a wonder,\n470  to call Telemachus home, your own dear son, Odysseus.\nHe’s journeyed to Lacedaemon’s rolling hills\nto see Menelaus, searching for news of you,\nhoping to learn if you are still alive.”\nShrewd Odysseus answered her at once:\n“Why not tell him the truth? You know it all.\nOr is he too —like father, like son —condemned\nto hardship, roving over the barren salt sea\nwhile strangers devour our livelihood right here?”\nBut the bright-eyed goddess reassured him firmly:\n480  “No need for anguish, trust me, not for him —\nI escorted your son myself\nso he might make his name by sailing there.\nNor is he saddled down with any troubles now.\nHe sits at ease in the halls of Menelaus,\nbathed in endless bounty . . . True enough,\nsome young lords in a black cutter lurk in ambush,\npoised to kill the prince before he reaches home,\nbut I have my doubts they will. Sooner the earth\nwill swallow down a few of those young gallants\n490  who eat you out of house and home these days!”\nNo more words, not now —\nAthena stroked Odysseus with her wand.\nShe shriveled the supple skin on his lithe limbs,\nstripped the russet curls from his head, covered his body\ntop to toe with the wrinkled hide of an old man\nand dimmed the fire in his eyes, so shining once.\nShe turned his shirt and cloak into squalid rags,\nripped and filthy, smeared with grime and soot.\nShe flung over this the long pelt of a bounding deer,\n500  rubbed bare, and gave him a staff and beggar’s sack,\ntorn and tattered, slung from a fraying rope.\nAll plans made,\nthey went their separate ways —Athena setting off\nto bring Telemachus home from hallowed Lacedaemon."

    "text": "So up from the haven now Odysseus climbed a rugged path\nthrough timber along high ground —Athena had shown the way —\nto reach the swineherd’s place, that fine loyal man\nwho of all the household hands Odysseus ever had\ncared the most for his master’s worldly goods.\nSitting at the door of his lodge he found him,\nthere in his farmstead, high-walled, broad and large,\nwith its long view on its cleared rise of ground . . .\nThe swineherd made those walls with his own hands\n10  to enclose the pigs of his master gone for years.\nAlone, apart from his queen or old Laertes,\nhe’d built them up of quarried blocks of stone\nand coped them well with a fence of wild pear.\nOutside he’d driven stakes in a long-line stockade,\na ring of thickset palings split from an oak’s dark heart.\nWithin the yard he’d built twelve sties, side-by-side,\nto bed his pigs, and in each one fifty brood-sows\nslept aground, penned and kept for breeding.\nThe boars slept outside, but far fewer of them,\n20  thanks to the lordly suitors’ feasts that kept on\nthinning the herd and kept the swineherd stepping,\nsending to town each day the best fat hog in sight.\nBy now they were down to three hundred and sixty head.\nBut guarding them all the time were dogs like savage beasts,\na pack of four, reared by the swineherd, foreman of men.\nThe man himself was fitting sandals to his feet,\ncarving away at an oxhide, dark and supple.\nAs for his men, three were off with their pigs,\nherding them here or there. Under orders he’d sent\n30  a fourth to town, with hog in tow for the gorging suitors\nto slaughter off and glut themselves with pork.\nSuddenly —those snarling dogs spotted Odysseus,\ncharged him fast —a shatter of barks —but Odysseus\nsank to the ground at once, he knew the trick:\nthe staff dropped from his hand but here and now,\non his own farm, he might have taken a shameful mauling.\nYes, but the swineherd, quick to move, dashed for the gate,\nflinging his oxhide down, rushed the dogs with curses,\nscattered them left and right with flying rocks\n40  and warned his master, “Lucky to be alive, old man —\na moment more, my pack would have torn you limb from limb!\nThen you’d have covered me with shame. As if the gods\nhad never given me blows and groans aplenty . . .\nHere I sit, my heart aching, broken for him,\nmy master, my great king —fattening up\nhis own hogs for other men to eat, while he,\nstarving for food, I wager, wanders the earth,\na beggar adrift in strangers’ cities, foreign-speaking lands,\nif he’s still alive, that is, still sees the rising sun.\n50  Come, follow me into my place, old man, so you,\nat least, can eat your fill of bread and wine.\nThen you can tell me where you’re from\nand all the pains you’ve weathered.”\nOn that note\nthe loyal swineherd led the way to his shelter,\nshowed his guest inside and sat Odysseus down\non brush and twigs he piled up for the visitor,\nflinging over these the skin of a shaggy wild goat,\nbroad and soft, the swineherd’s own good bedding.\nThe king, delighted to be so well received,\n60  thanked the man at once: “My host —may Zeus\nand the other gods give you your heart’s desire\nfor the royal welcome you have shown me here!”\nAnd you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“It’s wrong, my friend, to send any stranger packing —\neven one who arrives in worse shape than you.\nEvery stranger and beggar comes from Zeus\nand whatever scrap they get from the likes of us,\nthey’ll find it welcome. That’s the best we can do,\nwe servants, always cowed by our high and mighty masters,\n70  especially our young lords . . . But my old king?\nThe gods, they must have blocked his journey home.\nHe’d have treated me well, he would, with a house,\na plot of land and a wife you’d gladly prize.\nGoods that a kind lord will give a household hand\nwho labors for him, hard, whose work the gods have sped,\njust as they speed the work I labor at all day.\nMy master, I tell you, would have repaid me well\nif he’d grown old right here. But now he’s dead . . .\nIf only Helen and all her kind had died out too,\n80  brought to her knees, just as she cut the legs\nfrom under troops of men! My king among them,\nhe went off to the stallion-land of Troy\nto fight the Trojans, save Agamemnon’s honor!”\nhe brusquely cinched his belt around his shirt,\nstrode out to the pens, crammed with droves of pigs,\npicked out two, bundled them in and slaughtered both,\nsinged them, sliced them down, skewered them through\nand roasting all to a turn, set them before Odysseus,\nsizzling hot on the spits.\n90  Then coating the meat with white barley groats\nand mixing honeyed wine in a carved wooden bowl,\nhe sat down across from his guest, inviting warmly,\n“Eat up now, my friend. It’s all we slaves have got,\nscrawny pork, while the suitors eat the fatted hogs —\nno fear of the gods in their hard hearts, no mercy!\nTrust me, the blessed gods have no love for crime.\nThey honor justice, honor the decent acts of men.\nEven cutthroat bandits who raid foreign parts —\nand Zeus grants them a healthy share of plunder,\n100  ships filled to the brim, and back they head for home —\neven their dark hearts are stalked by the dread of vengeance.\nBut the suitors know, they’ve caught some godsent rumor\nof master’s grisly death! That’s why they have no mind\nto do their courting fairly or go back home in peace.\nNo, at their royal ease they devour all his goods,\nthose brazen rascals never spare a scrap!\nNot a day or a night goes by, sent down by Zeus,\nbut they butcher victims, never stopping at one or two,\nand drain his wine as if there’s no tomorrow —\n110  swilling the last drop . . .\nBelieve me, my master’s wealth was vast!\nNo other prince on earth could match his riches,\nnot on the loamy mainland or here at home in Ithaca —\nno twenty men in the world could equal his great treasures!\nLet me count them off for you. A dozen herds of cattle\nback on the mainland, just as many head of sheep,\nas many droves of pigs and goatflocks ranging free;\nhired hands or his own herdsmen keep them grazing there.\nHere in Ithaca, goatflocks, eleven in all, scatter\n120  to graze the island, out at the wild end,\nand trusty goatherds watch their every move.\nAnd each herdsman, day after day, it never ends,\ndrives in a beast for the suitors —best in sight,\na sheep or well-fed goat. While I tend to these pigs,\nI guard them, pick the best for those carousers\nand send it to the slaughter!”\nHis voice rose\nwhile the stranger ate his meat and drank his wine,\nravenous, bolting it all down in silence . . .\nbrooding on ways to serve the suitors right.\n130  But once he’d supped and refreshed himself with food,\nhe filled the wooden bowl he’d been drinking from,\nbrimmed it with wine and passed it to his host\nwho received the offer gladly, spirit cheered\nas the stranger probed him now with winging words:\n“Friend, who was the man who bought you with his goods,\nthe master of such vast riches, powerful as you say?\nYou tell me he died defending Agamemnon’s honor?\nWhat’s his name? I just might know such a man . . .\nZeus would know, and the other deathless gods,\n140  if I ever saw him, if I bring you any news.\nI’ve roamed the whole earth over.”\nAnd the good swineherd answered, foreman of men,\n“Old friend, no wanderer landing here with news of him\nis likely to win his wife and dear son over.\nRandom drifters, hungry for bed and board,\nlie through their teeth and swallow back the truth.\nWhy, any tramp washed up on Ithaca’s shores\nscurries right to my mistress, babbling lies,\nand she ushers him in, kindly, pressing for details,\n150  and the warm tears of grief come trickling down her cheeks,\nthe loyal wife’s way when her husband’s died abroad.\nEven you, old codger, could rig up some fine tale —\nand soon enough, I’d say,\nif they gave you shirt and clothing for your pains.\nMy master? Well, no doubt the dogs and wheeling birds\nhave ripped the skin from his ribs by now, his life is through —\nor fish have picked him clean at sea, and the man’s bones\nlie piled up on the mainland, buried deep in sand . . .\nhe’s dead and gone. Aye, leaving a broken heart\n160  for loved ones left behind, for me most of all.\nNever another master kind as he!\nI’ll never find one —no matter where I go,\nnot even if I went back to mother and father,\nthe house where I was born and my parents reared me once.\nAh, but much as I grieve for them, much as I long\nto lay my eyes on them, set foot on the old soil,\nit’s longing for him, him that wrings my heart —\nOdysseus, lost and gone!\nThat man, old friend, far away as he is . . .\n170  I can scarcely bear to say his name aloud,\nso deeply he loved me, cared for me, so deeply.\nWorlds away as he is, I call him Master, Brother!”\n“My friend,” the great Odysseus, long in exile, answered,\n“since you are dead certain, since you still insist\nhe’s never coming back, still the soul of denial,\nI won’t simply say it —on my oath I swear\nOdysseus is on his way!\nReward for such good news? Let me have it\nthe moment he sets foot in his own house,\n180  dress me in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes.\nBefore then, poor as I am, I wouldn’t take a thing.\nI hate that man like the very Gates of Death who,\nground down by poverty, stoops to peddling lies.\nI swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods,\nby this table of hospitality here, my host,\nby Odysseus’ hearth where I have come for help:\nall will come to pass, I swear, exactly as I say.\nTrue, this very month —just as the old moon dies\nand the new moon rises into life —Odysseus will return!\n190  He will come home and take revenge on any man\nwho offends his wedded wife and princely son!”\n“Good news,” you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“but I will never pay a reward for that, old friend —\nOdysseus, he’ll never come home again. Never . . .\nDrink your wine, sit back, let’s talk of other things.\nDon’t remind me of all this. The heart inside me\nbreaks when anyone mentions my dear master.\nThat oath of yours, we’ll let it pass —\noh come back! —\njust as I wish, I and Penelope,\n200  old Laertes too, Telemachus too, the godlike boy.\nHow I grieve for him now, I can’t stop —Odysseus’ son,\nTelemachus. The gods reared him up like a fine young tree\nand I often said, ‘In the ranks of men he’ll match his father,\nhis own dear father —amazing in build and looks, that boy!’\nBut all of a sudden a god wrecks his sense of balance —\ngod or man, no matter —off he’s gone to catch\nsome news of his father, down to holy Pylos.\nAnd now those gallant suitors lie in wait for him,\nsailing home, to tear the royal line of Arcesius\n210  out of Ithaca, root and branch, good name and all!\nEnough. Let him pass too —whether he’s trapped\nor the hand of Zeus will pull him through alive.\nold soldier, tell me the story of your troubles,\ntell me truly, too, I’d like to know it well . . .\nWho are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?\nWhat sort of vessel brought you? Why did the sailors\nland you here in Ithaca? Who did they say they are?\nI hardly think you came this way on foot.”\nThe great teller of tales returned at length,\n220  “My story —the whole truth —I’m glad to tell it all.\nIf only the two of us had food and mellow wine\nto last us long, here in your shelter now,\nfor us to sup on, undisturbed,\nwhile others take the work of the world in hand,\nI could easily spend all year and never reach the end\nof my endless story, all the heartbreaking trials\nI struggled through. The gods willed it so . . .\nI hail from Crete’s broad land, I’m proud to say,\nand I am a rich man’s son. And many other sons\n230  he brought up in his palace, born in wedlock,\nsprung of his lawful wife. Unlike my mother.\nShe was a slave, a concubine he’d purchased, yes,\nbut he treated me on a par with all his true-born sons —\nCastor, Hylax’ son. I’m proud to boast his blood, that man\nrevered like a god throughout all Crete those days,\nfor wealth, power and all his glorious offspring.\nBut the deadly spirits soon swept him down\nto the House of Death, and his high and mighty sons\ncarved up his lands and then cast lots for the parts\n240  and gave me just a pittance, a paltry house as well.\nBut I won myself a wife from wealthy, landed people,\nthanks to my own strong points. I was no fool\nand never shirked a fight.\nBut now my heyday’s gone —\nI’ve had my share of blows. Yet look hard at the husk\nand you’ll still see, I think, the grain that gave it life.\nBy heaven, Ares gave me courage, Athena too, to break\nthe ranks of men wide open, once, in the old days,\nwhenever I picked my troops and formed an ambush,\nplotting attacks to spring against our foes —\n250  no hint of death could daunt my fighting spirit!\nFar out of the front I’d charge and spear my man,\nI’d cut down any enemy soldier backing off.\nSuch was I in battle, true, but I had no love\nfor working the land, the chores of households either,\nthe labor that raises crops of shining children. No,\nit was always oarswept ships that thrilled my heart,\nand wars, and the long polished spears and arrows,\ndreadful gear that makes the next man cringe.\nI loved them all —god planted that love inside me.\n260  Each man delights in the work that suits him best.\nWhy, long before we Achaeans ever camped at Troy,\nnine commands I led in our deep-sea-going ships,\nraiding foreign men, and a fine haul reached my hands.\nI helped myself to the lion’s share and still more spoils\ncame by lot. And my house grew by leaps and bounds,\nI walked among the Cretans, honored, feared as well.\nBut then, when thundering Zeus contrived that expedition —\nthat disaster that brought so many fighters to their knees —\nand men kept pressing me and renowned Idomeneus\n270  to head a fleet to Troy,\nthere was no way out, no denying them then,\nthe voice of the people bore down much too hard.\nSo nine whole years we Achaeans soldiered on at Troy,\nin the tenth we sacked King Priam’s city, then embarked\nfor home in the long ships, and a god dispersed the fleet.\nUnlucky me. Shrewd old Zeus was plotting still more pain.\nNo more than a month I stayed at home, taking joy\nin my children, loyal wife and lovely plunder.\nBut a spirit in me urged, ‘Set sail for Egypt —\n280  fit out ships, take crews of seasoned heroes!’\nNine I fitted out, the men joined up at once\nand then six days my shipmates feasted well,\nwhile I provided a flock of sheep to offer up\nto the gods and keep the feasters’ table groaning.\nOn the seventh we launched out from the plains of Crete\nwith a stiff North Wind fair astern —smooth sailing,\naye, like coasting on downstream . . .\nAnd not one craft in our squadron foundered;\nall shipshape, and all hands sound, we sat back\n290  while the wind and helmsmen kept us true on course.\nFive days out and we raised the great river Nile\nand there in the Nile delta moored our ships of war.\nGod knows I ordered my trusty crews to stand by,\njust where they were, and guard the anchored fleet\nand I sent a patrol to scout things out from higher ground.\nBut swept away by their own reckless fury, the crew went berserk —\nthey promptly began to plunder the lush Egyptian farms,\ndragged off the women and children, killed the men.\nOutcries reached the city in no time —stirred by shouts\n300  the entire town came streaming down at the break of day,\nfilling the river plain with chariots, ranks of infantry\nand the gleam of bronze. Zeus who loves the lightning\nflung down murderous panic on all my men-at-arms —\nno one dared to stand his ground and fight,\ndisaster ringed us round from every quarter.\nDroves of my men they hacked down with swords,\nled off the rest alive, to labor for them as slaves.\nAnd I? Zeus flashed an inspiration through my mind,\nthough I wish I’d died a soldier down in Egypt then!\n310  A world of pain, you see, still lay in wait for me . . .\nQuickly I wrenched the skullcap helmet off my head,\nI tore the shield from my back and dropped my spear\nand ran right into the path of the king’s chariot,\nhugged and kissed his knees. He pitied me, spared me,\nhoisted me onto his war-car, took me home in tears.\nTroops of his men came rushing after, shaking javelins,\nmad to kill me —their fighting blood at the boil —\nbut their master drove them off.\nHe feared the wrath of Zeus, the god of guests,\nthe first of the gods to pay back acts of outrage.\n320                                                     So,\nthere I lingered for seven years, amassing a fortune\nfrom all the Egyptian people loading me with gifts.\nThen, at last, when the eighth had come full turn,\nalong comes this Phoenician one fine day . . .\na scoundrel, swindler, an old hand at lies\nwho’d already done the world a lot of damage.\nWell, he smoothly talked me round and off we sailed,\nPhoenicia-bound, where his house and holdings lay.\nThere in his care I stayed till the year was out.\n330  Then, when the months and days had run their course\nand the year wheeled round and the seasons came again,\nhe conned me aboard his freighter bound for Libya,\npretending I’d help him ship a cargo there for sale\nbut in fact he’d sell me there and make a killing!\nI suspected as much, of course, but had no choice,\nso I boarded with him, yes, and the ship ran on\nwith a good strong North Wind gusting —\nfast on the middle passage clear of Crete —\nbut Zeus was brewing mischief for that crew . . .\n340  Once we’d left the island in our wake —\nno land at all in sight, nothing but sea and sky —\nthen Zeus the son of Cronus mounted a thunderhead\nabove our hollow ship and the deep went black beneath it.\nThen, then in the same breath Zeus hit the craft\nwith a lightning-bolt and thunder. Round she spun,\nreeling under the impact, filled with reeking brimstone,\nshipmates pitching out of her, bobbing round like seahawks\nswept along by the breakers past the trim black hull —\nand the god cut short their journey home forever.\n350  Zeus himself —when I was just at the final gasp —\nthrust the huge mast of my dark-prowed vessel\nright into my arms so I might flee disaster\none more time. Wrapping myself around it,\nI was borne along by the wretched galewinds,\nrushed along nine days —on the tenth, at dead of night,\na shouldering breaker rolled me up along Thesprotia’s beaches.\nThere the king of Thesprotia, Phidon, my salvation,\ntreated me kindly, asked for no reward at all.\nHis own good son had found me, half-dead\n360  from exhaustion and the cold. He raised me up\nby the hand and led me home to his father’s house\nand dressed me in cloak and shirt and decent clothes.\nThat’s where I first got wind of him —Odysseus . . .\nThe king told me he’d hosted the man in style,\nbefriended him on his way home to native land,\nand showed me all the treasure Odysseus had amassed.\nBronze and gold and plenty of hard wrought iron,\nenough to last a man and ten generations of his heirs —\nso great the wealth stored up for him in the king’s vaults!\nBut Odysseus, he made clear, was off at Dodona then\nto hear the will of Zeus that rustles forth\nfrom the god’s tall leafy oak: how should he return,\nafter all the years away, to his own green land of Ithaca —\nopenly or in secret? Phidon swore to me, what’s more,\nas the princely man poured out libations in his house,\n‘The ship’s hauled down and the crew set to sail,\nto take Odysseus home to native land.’\nBut I . . .\nhe shipped me off before. A Thesprotian cutter\nchanced to be heading for Dulichion rich in wheat,\nso he told the crew to take me to the king, Acastus,\ntreat me kindly, too, but it pleased them more\nto scheme foul play against me,\nsink me into the very depths of pain. As soon\nas the ship was far off land, scudding in mid-sea,\nthey sprang their trap —my day of slavery then and there!\nThey stripped from my back the shirt and cloak I wore,\ndecked me out in a new suit of clothes, all rags,\nripped and filthy —the rags you see right now.\nBut then, once they’d gained the fields of Ithaca,\n390  still clear in the evening light, they lashed me fast\nto the rowing-benches, twisting a cable round me;\nall hands went ashore\nand rushed to catch their supper on the beach.\nBut the gods themselves unhitched my knots at once\nwith the gods’ own ease. I wrapped my head in rags,\nslid down the gangplank polished smooth, slipped my body\ninto the water, not a splash, chest-high, then quick,\nlaunched out with both my arms and swam away —\nout of the surf in no time, clear of the crew.\n400  I clambered upland, into a flowery, fragrant brush\nand crouched there, huddling low. They raised a hue and cry,\nwildly beat the bushes, but when it seemed no use\nto pursue the hunt, back they trudged again and\nboarded their empty ship.\nThe gods hid me themselves —\nit’s light work for them —and brought me here,\nthe homestead of a man who knows the world.\nSo it seems to be my lot that I’ll live on.”\nAnd you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“So much misery, friend! You’ve moved my heart,\n410  deeply, with your long tale . . . such blows, such roving.\nBut one part’s off the mark, I know —you’ll never persuade me —\nwhat you say about Odysseus. A man in your condition,\nwho are you, I ask you, to lie for no good reason?\nWell I know the truth of my good lord’s return,\nhow the gods detested him, with a vengeance —\nnever letting him go under, fighting Trojans,\nor die in the arms of loved ones,\nonce he’d wound down the long coil of war.\nThen all united Achaea would have raised his tomb\n420  and he’d have won his son great fame for years to come.\nBut now the whirlwinds have ripped him away —no fame for him!\nAnd I live here, cut off from the world, with all my pigs.\nI never go into town unless, perhaps, wise Penelope\ncalls me back, when news drops in from nowhere.\nThere they crowd the messenger, cross-examine him,\nheartsick for their long-lost lord or all too glad\nto eat him out of house and home, scot-free.\nBut I’ve no love for all that probing, prying,\nnot since some Aetolian fooled me with his yarn.\n430  He’d killed a man, wandered over the face of the earth,\nstumbled onto my hut, and I received him warmly.\nHe told me he’d seen Odysseus\nlodged with King Idomeneus down in Crete —\nrefitting his ships, hard-hit by the gales,\nbut he’d be home, he said, by summer or harvest-time,\nhis hulls freighted with treasure, manned by fighting crews.\nSo you, old misery, seeing a god has led you here to me,\ndon’t try to charm me now, don’t spellbind me with lies!\nNever for that will I respect you, treat you kindly;\n440  no, it’s my fear of Zeus, the god of guests,\nand because I pity you . . .”\n“Good god,” the crafty man pressed on,\n“what a dark, suspicious heart you have inside you!\nNot even my oath can win you over, make you see the light.\nCome, strike a bargain —all the gods of Olympus\nwitness now our pact!\nIf your master returns, here to your house,\ndress me in shirt and cloak and send me off\nto Dulichion at once, the place I long to be.\n450  But if your master doesn’t return as I predict,\nset your men on me —fling me off some rocky crag\nso the next beggar here may just think twice\nbefore he peddles lies.”\n“Surely, friend!” —\nthe swineherd shook his head —“and just think\nof the praise and fame I’d win among mankind,\nnow and for all time to come, if first I took you\nunder my roof, I treated you kindly as my guest\nthen cut you down and robbed you of your life —\nhow keen I’d be to say my prayers to Zeus!\n460  But it’s high time for a meal.\nI hope the men will be home at any moment\nso we can fix a tasty supper in the lodge.”\nAs host and guest confided back and forth\nthe herdsmen came in, driving their hogs up close,\npenning sows in their proper sties for the night,\nsquealing for all they’re worth, shut inside their yard,\nand the good swineherd shouted to his men,\n“Bring in your fattest hog!\nI’ll slaughter it for our guest from far abroad.\n470  We’ll savor it ourselves. All too long we’ve sweated\nover these white-tusked boars —our wretched labor —\nwhile others wolf our work down free of charge!”\nCalling out\nas he split up kindling now with a good sharp ax\nand his men hauled in a tusker five years old,\nrippling fat, and stood him steady by the hearth.\nThe swineherd, soul of virtue, did not forget the gods.\nHe began the rite by plucking tufts from the porker’s head,\nthrew them into the fire and prayed to all the powers,\n“Bring him home, our wise Odysseus, home at last!”\n480  Then raising himself full-length, with an oak log\nhe’d left unsplit he clubbed and stunned the beast\nand it gasped out its life . . .\nThe men slashed its throat, singed the carcass,\nquickly quartered it all, and then the swineherd,\ncutting first strips for the gods from every limb,\nspread them across the thighs, wrapped in sleek fat,\nand sprinkling barley over them, flung them on the fire.\nThey sliced the rest into pieces, pierced them with skewers,\nbroiled them all to a turn and, pulling them off the spits,\n490  piled the platters high. The swineherd, standing up\nto share the meat —his sense of fairness perfect —\ncarved it all out into seven equal portions.\nOne he set aside, lifting up a prayer\nto the forest nymphs and Hermes, Maia’s son,\nand the rest he handed on to each man in turn.\nBut to Odysseus he presented the boar’s long loin\nand the cut of honor cheered his master’s heart.\nThe man for all occasions thanked his host:\n“I pray, Eumaeus, you’ll be as dear to Father Zeus\n500  as you are to me —a man in my condition —\nyou honor me by giving me your best.”\nYou replied in kind, Eumaeus, swineherd:\n“Eat, my strange new friend . . . enjoy it now,\nit’s all we have to offer. As for Father Zeus,\none thing he will give and another he’ll hold back,\nwhatever his pleasure. All things are in his power.”\nHe burned choice parts for the gods who never die\nand pouring glistening wine in a full libation,\nplaced the cup in his guest’s hands —Odysseus,\n510  raider of cities —and down he sat to his own share.\nMesaulius served them bread, a man the swineherd\npurchased for himself in his master’s absence —\nalone, apart from his queen or old Laertes —\nbought him from Taphians, bartered his own goods.\nThey reached out for the spread that lay at hand\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nMesaulius cleared the things away. And now, content\nwith bread and meat, they made for bed at once.\nA foul night came on —the dark of the moon —and Zeus\n520  rained from dusk to dawn and a sodden West Wind raged.\nOdysseus spoke up now, keen to test the swineherd.\nWould he take his cloak off, hand it to his guest\nor at least tell one of his men to do the same?\nHe cared for the stranger so, who ventured now,\n“Listen, Eumaeus, and all you comrades here,\nallow me to sing my praises for a moment.\nSay it’s the wine that leads me on, the wild wine\nthat sets the wisest man to sing at the top of his lungs,\nlaugh like a fool —it drives the man to dancing . . . it even\n530  tempts him to blurt out stories better never told.\nBut now that I’m sounding off, I can’t hold back.\nOh make me young again, and the strength inside me\nsteady as a rock! Just as I was that day\nwe sprang a sudden ambush against the Trojans.\nOdysseus led the raid with Atreus’ son Menelaus.\nI was third in command —they’d chosen me themselves.\nOnce we’d edged up under the city’s steep ramparts,\ncrowding the walls but sinking into the thick brake,\nthe reeds and marshy flats, huddling under our armor\n540  there we lay, and a foul night came on, the North Wind struck,\nfreezing cold, and down from the skies the snow fell like frost,\npacked hard —the rims of our shields armored round with ice.\nThere all the rest of the men wore shirts and cloaks and,\nhunching shields over their shoulders, slept at ease.\nNot I. I’d left my cloak at camp when I set out —\nidiot —never thinking it might turn cold,\nso I joined in with just the shield on my back\nand a shining waist-guard . . . But then at last,\nthe night’s third watch, the stars just wheeling down —\n550  I muttered into his ear, Odysseus, right beside me,\nnudging him with an elbow —he perked up at once —\n‘Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, full of tactics,\nI’m not long for the living. The cold will do me in.\nSee, I’ve got no cloak. Some spirit’s fooled me —\nI came out half-dressed. Now there’s no escape!’\nI hadn’t finished —a thought flashed in his mind;\nno one could touch the man at plots or battles.\n‘Shhh!’ he hissed back —Odysseus had a plan —\n‘One of our fighters over there might hear you.’\n560  Then he propped his head on his forearm, calling out,\n‘Friends, wake up. I slept and a god sent down a dream.\nIt warned that we’re too far from the ships, exposed.\nGo, someone, tell Agamemnon, our field marshal —\nhe might rush reinforcements from the beach.’\nThoas, son of Andraemon, sprang up at once,\nflung off his purple cloak and ran to the ships\nwhile I, bundling into his wrap, was glad at heart\ntill Dawn rose on her golden throne once more.\nOh make me young again\n570  and the strength inside me steady as a rock!\nOne of the swineherds here would lend a wrap\nfor love of a good soldier, respect as well.\nNow they spurn me, dressed in filthy rags.”\nAnd you replied, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“Now that was a fine yarn you told, old-timer,\nnot without point, not without profit either.\nYou won’t want for clothes or whatever else\nis due a worn-out traveler come for help —\nnot for tonight at least. Tomorrow morning\n580  you’ll have to flap around in rags again.\nHere we’ve got no store of shirts and cloaks,\nno changes. Just one wrap per man, that’s all.\nBut just you wait till Odysseus’ dear son comes back —\nthat boy will deck you out in a cloak and shirt\nand send you off, wherever your heart desires!”\nhe rose to his feet and laid out a bed by the fire,\nthrowing over it skins of sheep and goats and\ndown Odysseus lay. Eumaeus flung on his guest\nthe heavy flaring cloak he kept in reserve\nto wear when winter brought some wild storm.\n590                                                  So here\nOdysseus slept and the young hands slept beside him.\nNot the swineherd. Not his style to bed indoors,\napart from his pigs. He geared up to go outside\nand it warmed Odysseus’ heart,\nEumaeus cared so much for his absent master’s goods.\nFirst, over his broad shoulders he slung a whetted sword,\nwrapped himself in a cloak stitched tight to block the wind,\nand adding a cape, the pelt of a shaggy well-fed goat,\nhe took a good sharp lance to fight off men and dogs.\n600  Then out he went to sleep where his white-tusked boars\nhad settled down for the night . . . just under\na jutting crag that broke the North Wind’s blast."

    "text": "Now south through the spacious dancing-rings of Lacedaemon\nAthena went to remind the hero’s princely son\nof his journey home and spur him on his way.\nShe found him there with Nestor’s gallant son,\nbedded down in the porch of illustrious Menelaus —\nPisistratus, at least, overcome with deep sound sleep,\nbut not Telemachus. Welcome sleep could not hold him.\nAll through the godsent night he lay awake . . .\ntossing with anxious thoughts about his father.\n10  Hovering over him, eyes ablaze, Athena said,\n“It’s wrong, Telemachus, wrong to rove so far,\nso long from home, leaving your own holdings\nunprotected —crowds in your palace so brazen\nthey’ll carve up all your wealth, devour it all,\nand then your journey here will come to nothing.\nQuickly, press Menelaus, lord of the warcry,\nto speed you home at once, if you want to find\nyour irreproachable mother still inside your house.\nEven now her father and brothers urge Penelope\n20  to marry Eurymachus, who excels all other suitors\nat giving gifts and drives the bride-price higher.\nShe must not carry anything off against your will!\nYou know how the heart of a woman always works:\nshe likes to build the wealth of her new groom —\nof the sons she bore, of her dear, departed husband,\nnot a memory of the dead, no questions asked.\nSo sail for home, I say!\nWith your own hands turn over all your goods\nto the one serving-woman you can trust the most,\n30  till the gods bring to light your own noble bride.\nAnd another thing. Take it to heart, I tell you.\nPicked men of the suitors lie in ambush, grim-set\nin the straits between Ithaca and rocky Same,\npoised to kill you before you can reach home,\nbut I have my doubts they will. Sooner the earth\nwill swallow down a few of those young gallants\nwho eat you out of house and home these days!\nJust give the channel islands a wide berth,\npush on in your trim ship, sail night and day,\n40  and the deathless god who guards and pulls you through\nwill send you a fresh fair wind from hard astern.\nAt your first landfall, Ithaca’s outer banks,\nspeed ship and shipmates round to the city side.\nBut you —you make your way to the swineherd first,\nin charge of your pigs, and true to you as always.\nSleep the night there, send him to town at once\nto tell the news to your mother, wise Penelope —\nyou’ve made it back from Pylos safe and sound.”\nMission accomplished, back she went to Olympus’ heights\n50  as Telemachus woke Nestor’s son from his sweet sleep;\nhe dug a heel in his ribs and roused him briskly:\n“Up, Pisistratus. Hitch the team to the chariot —\nlet’s head for home at once!”\n“No, Telemachus,”\nNestor’s son objected, “much as we long to go,\nwe cannot drive a team in the dead of night.\nMorning will soon be here. So wait, I say,\nwait till he loads our chariot down with gifts —\nthe hero Atrides, Menelaus, the great spearman —\nand gives us warm salutes and sees us off like princes.\n60  That’s the man a guest will remember all his days:\nthe lavish host who showers him with kindness.”\nAt those words Dawn rose on her golden throne\nand Menelaus, lord of the warcry, rising up from bed\nby the side of Helen with her loose and lovely hair,\nwalked toward his guests. As soon as he saw him,\nTelemachus rushed to pull a shimmering tunic on,\nover his broad shoulders threw his flaring cape\nand the young prince, son of King Odysseus,\nstrode out to meet his host: “Menelaus,\n70  royal son of Atreus, captain of armies,\nlet me go back to my own country now.\nThe heart inside me longs for home at last.”\nThe lord of the warcry reassured the prince,\n“I’d never detain you here too long, Telemachus,\nnot if your heart is set on going home.\nI’d find fault with another host, I’m sure,\ntoo warm to his guests, too pressing or too cold.\nBalance is best in all things. It’s bad either way,\nspurring the stranger home who wants to linger,\nholding the one who longs to leave —you know,\n‘Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest!’\nBut wait till I load your chariot down with gifts —\nfine ones, too, you’ll see with your own eyes —\nand tell the maids to serve a meal at hall.\nWe have god’s plenty here.\nIt’s honor and glory to us, a help to you as well\nif you dine in style first, then leave to see the world.\nAnd if you’re keen for the grand tour of all Hellas,\nright to the depths of Argos, I’ll escort you myself,\n90  harness the horses, guide you through the towns.\nAnd no host will turn us away with empty hands,\neach will give us at least one gift to prize —\na handsome tripod, cauldron forged in bronze,\na brace of mules or a solid golden cup.”\nFirmly resolved, Telemachus replied,\n“Menelaus, royal Atrides, captain of armies,\nI must go back to my own home at once.\nWhen I started out I left no one behind\nto guard my own possessions. God forbid,\n100  searching for my great father, I lose my life\nor lose some priceless treasure from my house!”\nAs soon as the lord of the warcry heard that,\nhe told his wife and serving-women to lay out a meal\nin the hall at once. They’d stores aplenty there.\nEteoneus, son of Boëthous, came to join them —\nfresh from bed, he lived close by the palace.\nThe warlord Menelaus told him to build a fire\nand broil some meat. He quickly did his bidding.\nDown Atrides walked to a storeroom filled with scent,\n110  and not alone: Helen and Megapenthes went along.\nReaching the spot where all the heirlooms lay,\nMenelaus chose a generous two-handled cup;\nhe told his son Megapenthes to take a mixing-bowl,\nsolid silver, while Helen lingered beside the chests,\nand there they were, brocaded, beautiful robes\nher own hands had woven. Queenly Helen,\nradiance of women, lifted one from the lot,\nthe largest, loveliest robe, and richly worked\nand like a star it glistened, deep beneath the others.\n120  Then all three went up and on through the halls until\nthey found Telemachus. The red-haired king spoke out:\n“Oh my boy, may Zeus the Thunderer, Hera’s lord,\ngrant you the journey home your heart desires!\nOf all the treasures lying heaped in my palace\nyou shall have the finest, most esteemed. Look,\nI’ll give you this mixing-bowl, forged to perfection —\nit’s solid silver finished off with a lip of gold.\nHephaestus made it himself. And a royal friend,\nPhaedimus, king of Sidon, lavished it on me\n130  when his palace welcomed me on passage home.\nHow pleased I’d be if you took it as a gift!”\nAnd the warlord placed the two-eared cup\nin his hands while stalwart Megapenthes carried in\nthe glittering silver bowl and set it down before him.\nHelen, her cheeks flushed with beauty, moved beside him,\nholding the robe in her arms, and offered, warmly,\n“Here, dear boy, I too have a gift to give you,\na keepsake of Helen —I wove it with my hands —\nfor your own bride to wear\n140  when the blissful day of marriage dawns . . .\nUntil then, let it rest in your mother’s room.\nAnd may you return in joy —my parting wish —\nto your own grand house, your native land at last.”\nshe laid the robe in his arms, and he received it gladly.\nPrince Pisistratus, taking the gifts, stowed them deep\nin the chariot cradle, viewed them all with wonder.\nThe red-haired warlord led them back to his house\nand the guests took seats on low and high-backed chairs.\nA maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher\n150  and over a silver basin tipped it out\nso they might rinse their hands,\nthen pulled a gleaming table to their side.\nA staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them,\nappetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.\nReady Eteoneus carved and passed the meat,\nthe son of illustrious Menelaus poured their wine.\nThey reached out for the good things that lay at hand\nand once they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nPrince Telemachus and the gallant son of Nestor\n160  yoked their team, mounted the blazoned car\nand drove through the gates and echoing colonnade.\nThe red-haired King Menelaus followed both boys out,\nhis right hand holding a golden cup of honeyed wine\nso the two might pour libations forth at parting.\nJust in front of the straining team he strode,\nlifting his cup and pledging both his guests:\n“Farewell, my princes! Give my warm greetings\nto Nestor, the great commander,\nalways kind to me as a father, long ago\n170  when we young men of Achaea fought at Troy.”\nAnd tactful Telemachus replied at once,\n“Surely, my royal host, we’ll tell him all,\nas soon as we reach old Nestor —all you say.\nI wish I were just as sure I’d find Odysseus\nwaiting there at home when I reach Ithaca.\nI’d tell him I come from you,\ntreated with so much kindness at your hands,\nloaded down with all these priceless gifts!”\nAt his last words a bird flew past on the right,\n180  an eagle clutching a huge white goose in its talons,\nplucked from the household yards. And all rushed after,\nshouting, men and women, and swooping toward the chariot now\nthe bird veered off to the right again before the horses.\nAll looked up, overjoyed —people’s spirits lifted.\nNestor’s son Pisistratus spoke out first:\n“Look there! King Menelaus, captain of armies,\nwhat, did the god send down that sign for you\nor the two of us?”\nThe warlord fell to thinking —\nhow to read the omen rightly, how to reply? . . .\n190  But long-robed Helen stepped in well before him:\n“Listen to me and I will be your prophet,\nsure as the gods have flashed it in my mind\nand it will come to pass, I know it will.\nJust as the eagle swooped down from the crags\nwhere it was born and bred, just as it snatched\nthat goose fattened up for the kill inside the house,\njust so, after many trials and roving long and hard,\nOdysseus will descend on his house and take revenge —\nunless he’s home already, sowing seeds of ruin\nfor that whole crowd of suitors!”\n200                                      “Oh if only,”\npensive Telemachus burst out in thanks to Helen,\n“Zeus the thundering lord of Hera makes it so —\neven at home I’ll pray to you as a deathless goddess!”\nHe cracked the lash and the horses broke quickly,\ncareering through the city out into open country,\nshaking the yoke across their shoulders all day long.\nThe sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark\nas they reached Phera, pulling up to Diocles’ halls,\nthe son of Ortilochus, son of the Alpheus River.\n210  He gave them a royal welcome; there they slept the night.\nWhen young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthey yoked their pair again, mounted the blazoned car\nand out through the gates and echoing colonnade\nthey whipped the team to a run and on they flew,\nholding nothing back, approaching Pylos soon,\nthe craggy citadel. That was when Telemachus\nturned to Pisistratus, saying, “Son of Nestor,\nwon’t you do as I ask you, see it through?\nWe’re friends for all our days now, so we claim,\n220  thanks to our fathers’ friendship. We’re the same age as well\nand this tour of ours has made us more like brothers.\nPrince, don’t drive me past my vessel, drop me there.\nYour father’s old, in love with his hospitality;\nI fear he’ll hold me, chafing in his palace —\nI must hurry home!”\nThe son of Nestor pondered . . .\nhow to do it properly, see it through?\nPausing a moment, then this way seemed best.\nSwerving his team, he drove down to the ship\ntied up on shore and loaded into her stern\n230  the splendid gifts, the robes and gold Menelaus gave,\nand sped his friend with a flight of winging words:\n“Climb aboard now —fast! Muster all your men\nbefore I get home and break the news to father.\nWith that man’s overbearing spirit —I know it,\nknow it all too well —he’ll never let you go,\nhe’ll come down here and summon you himself.\nHe won’t return without you, believe me —\nin any case he’ll fly into a rage.”\nWith that warning he whipped his sleek horses\n240  back to Pylos city and reached his house in no time.\nTelemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates:\n“Stow our gear, my comrades, deep in the holds\nand board at once —we must be on our way!”\nHis shipmates snapped to orders,\nswung aboard and sat to the oars in ranks.\nBut just as Telemachus prepared to launch,\npraying, sacrificing to Pallas by the stern,\na man from a far-off country came toward him now,\na fugitive out of Argos: he had killed a man . . .\nHe was a prophet, sprung of Melampus’ line of seers,\nMelampus who lived in Pylos, mother of flocks, some years ago,\nrich among his Pylians, at home in his great high house.\nBut then he was made to go abroad to foreign parts,\nfleeing his native land and hot-blooded Neleus —\nmost imperious man alive —who’d commandeered\nhis vast estate and held it down by force\nfor one entire year. That year Melampus,\nbound by cruel chains in the halls of Phylacus,\nsuffered agonies —all for Neleus’ daughter Pero,\n260  that and the mad spell a Fury, murderous spirit,\ncast upon his mind. But the seer worked free of death\nand drove the lusty, bellowing cattle out of Phylace,\nback to Pylos. There he avenged himself on Neleus\nfor the shameful thing the king had done to him,\nand escorted Pero home as his brother’s bride.\nBut he himself went off to a distant country,\nArgos, land of stallions —his destined home\nwhere he would live and rule the Argive nation.\nHere he married a wife and built a high-roofed house\nand sired Antiphates and Mantius, two staunch sons.\nAntiphates fathered Oicles, gallant heart,\nOicles fathered Amphiaraus, driver of armies,\nwhom storming Zeus and Apollo loved intensely,\nshowering him with every form of kindness.\nBut he never reached the threshold of old age,\nhe died at Thebes —undone by a bribe his wife accepted —\nleaving behind his two sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus.\nOn his side Mantius sired Polyphides and Clitus both\nbut Dawn of the golden throne whisked Clitus away,\n280  overwhelmed by his beauty,\nso the boy would live among the deathless gods.\nYet Apollo made magnanimous Polyphides a prophet —\nafter Amphiaraus’ death —the greatest seer on earth.\nBut a feud with his father drove him off to Hyperesia\nwhere he made his home and prophesied to the world . . .\nThis prophet’s son it was —Theoclymenus his name —\nwho approached Telemachus now and found him pouring\nwine to a god and saying prayers beside his ship.\n“Friend,” he said in a winging supplication,\n290  “since I find you burning offerings here,\nI beg you by these rites and the god you pray to,\nthen by your own life and the lives of all the men\nwho travel with you —tell me truly, don’t hold back,\nwho are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?”\n“Of course, stranger,” the forthright prince responded,\n“I will tell you everything, clearly as I can.\nIthaca is my country. Odysseus is my father —\nthere was a man, or was he all a dream? . . .\nbut he’s surely died a wretched death by now.\n300  Yet here I’ve come with my crew and black ship,\nout for news of my father, lost and gone so long.”\nAnd the godlike seer Theoclymenus replied,\n“Just like you, I too have left my land —\nI because I killed a man of my own tribe.\nBut he has many brothers and kin in Argos,\nstallion-land, who rule the plains in force.\nFleeing death at their hands, a dismal fate,\nI am a fugitive now,\ndoomed to wander across this mortal world.\n310  So take me aboard, hear a fugitive’s prayer:\ndon’t let them kill me —they’re after me, well I know!”\n“So desperate!” thoughtful Telemachus exclaimed.\n“How could I drive you from my ship? Come sail with us,\nwe’ll tend you at home, with all we can provide.”\nAnd he took the prophet’s honed bronze spear,\nlaid it down full-length on the rolling deck,\nswung aboard the deep-sea craft himself,\nassuming the pilot’s seat reserved astern\nand put the seer beside him. Cables cast off,\n320  Telemachus shouted out commands to all his shipmates:\n“All lay hands to tackle!” They sprang to orders,\nhoisting the pinewood mast, they stepped it firm\nin its block amidships, lashed it fast with stays\nand with braided rawhide halyards hauled the white sail high.\nNow bright-eyed Athena sent them a stiff following wind\nblustering out of a clear sky, gusting on so the ship\nmight run its course through the salt sea at top speed —\nand past the Springs she raced and the Chalcis’ rushing stream\nas the sun sank and the roads of the world grew dark and\non she pressed for Pheae, driven on by a wind from Zeus\nand flew past lovely Elis, where Epeans rule in power,\nand then Telemachus veered for the Jagged Islands,\nwondering all the way —\nwould he sweep clear of death or be cut down?\nThe king and loyal swineherd, just that night,\nwere supping with other fieldhands in the lodge.\nAnd once they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nOdysseus spoke up, eager to test the swineherd,\nsee if he’d stretch out his warm welcome now,\n340  invite him to stay on in the farmstead here\nor send him off to town. “Listen, Eumaeus,\nall you comrades here —at the crack of dawn\nI mean to go to town and do my begging,\nnot be a drain on you and all your men.\nBut advise me well, give me a trusty guide\nto see me there. And then I’m on my own\nto roam the streets —I must, I have no choice —\nhoping to find a handout, just a crust or cupful.\nI’d really like to go to the house of King Odysseus\n350  and give my news to his cautious queen, Penelope.\nWhy, I’d even mix with those overweening suitors —\nwould they spare me a plateful? Look at all they have!\nI’d do good work for them, promptly, anything they want.\nLet me tell you, listen closely, catch my drift . . .\nThanks to Hermes the guide, who gives all work\nof our hands the grace and fame that it deserves,\nno one alive can match me at household chores:\nbuilding a good fire, splitting kindling neatly,\ncarving, roasting meat and pouring rounds of wine . . .\n360  anything menials do to serve their noble masters.”\n“God’s sake, my friend!” you broke in now,\nEumaeus, loyal swineherd, deeply troubled.\n“What’s got into your head, what crazy plan?\nYou must be hell-bent on destruction, on the spot,\nif you’re keen to mingle with that mob of suitors —\ntheir pride and violence hit the iron skies!\nThey’re a far cry from you,\nthe men who do their bidding. Young bucks,\nall rigged out in their fine robes and shirts,\n370  hair sleeked down with oil, faces always beaming,\nthe ones who slave for them! The tables polished,\nsagging under the bread and meat and wine.\nNo, stay here. No one finds you a burden,\nsurely not I, nor any comrade here.\nYou wait till Odysseus’ dear son comes back —\nthat boy will deck you out in a cloak and shirt\nand send you off, wherever your heart desires!”\n“If only, Eumaeus,” the wayworn exile said,\n“you were as dear to Father Zeus as you are to me!\n380  You who stopped my pain, my endless, homesick roving.\nTramping about the world —there’s nothing worse for a man.\nBut the fact is that men put up with misery\nto stuff their cursed bellies.\nBut seeing you hold me here, urging me now\nto wait for him, the prince who’s on his way,\ntell me about the mother of King Odysseus, please,\nthe father he left as well —on the threshold of old age —\nwhen he sailed off to war. Are they still alive,\nperhaps, still looking into the light of day?\nOr dead by now, and down in Death’s long house?”\n390                                                    “Friend,”\nthe swineherd, foreman of men, assured his guest,\n“I’ll tell you the whole story, point by point.\nLaertes is still alive, but night and day\nhe prays to Zeus, waiting there in his house,\nfor the life breath to slip away and leave his body.\nHis heart’s so racked for his son, lost and gone these years,\nfor his wife so fine, so wise —her death is the worst blow\nhe’s had to suffer —it made him old before his time.\nShe died of grief for her boy, her glorious boy,\n400  it wore her down, a wretched way to go.\nI pray that no one I love dies such a death,\nno island neighbor of mine who treats me kindly!\nWhile she was still alive, heartsick as she was,\nit always moved me to ask about her, learn the news.\nShe’d reared me herself, and right beside her daughter,\nCtimene, graceful girl with her long light gown,\nthe youngest one she’d borne . . .\nJust the two of us, growing up together,\nthe woman tending me almost like her child,\n410  till we both reached the lovely flush of youth\nand then her parents gave her away in marriage, yes,\nto a Samian man, and a haul of gifts they got.\nBut her mother decked me out in cloak and shirt,\ngood clothing she wrapped about me —gave me sandals,\nsent me here, this farm. She loved me from the heart.\nOh how I miss her kindness now! The happy gods\nspeed the work that I labor at, that gives me\nfood and drink to spare for the ones I value.\nBut from Queen Penelope I never get a thing,\n420  never a winning word, no friendly gesture,\nnot since this, this plague has hit the house —\nthese high and mighty suitors. Servants miss it,\nterribly, gossiping back and forth with the mistress,\ngathering scraps of news, a snack and a cup or two,\nthen taking home to the fields some little gift.\nIt never fails to cheer a servant’s heart.”\n“Imagine that,” his canny master said,\n“you must have been just a little fellow, Eumaeus,\nwhen you were swept so far from home and parents.\n430  Come, tell me the whole story, truly too.\nWas your city sacked? —\nsome city filled with people and wide streets\nwhere your father and your mother made their home?\nOr were you all alone, herding your sheep and cattle,\nwhen pirates kidnapped, shipped and sold you off\nto this man’s house, who paid a healthy price?”\n“My friend,” the swineherd answered, foreman of men,\n“you really want my story? So many questions —well,\nlisten in quiet, then, and take your ease, sit back\n440  and drink your wine. The nights are endless now.\nWe’ve plenty of time to sleep or savor a long tale.\nNo need, you know, to turn in before the hour.\nEven too much sleep can be a bore.\nBut anyone else who feels the urge\ncan go to bed and then, at the crack of dawn,\nbreak bread, turn out and tend our master’s pigs.\nWe two will keep to the shelter here, eat and drink\nand take some joy in each other’s heartbreaking sorrows,\nsharing each other’s memories. Over the years, you know,\n450  a man finds solace even in old sorrows, true, a man\nwho’s weathered many blows and wandered many miles.\nMy own story? This will answer all your questions . . .\nThere’s an island, Syrie —you may have heard of it —\noff above Ortygia, out where the sun wheels around.\nNot so packed with people, still a good place, though,\nfine for sheep and cattle, rich in wine and wheat.\nHunger never attacks the land, no sickness either,\nthat always stalks the lives of us poor men.\nNo, as each generation grows old on the island,\n460  down Apollo comes with his silver bow, with Artemis,\nand they shoot them all to death with gentle arrows.\nTwo cities there are, that split the land in half,\nand over them both my father ruled in force —\nOrmenus’ son Ctesius, a man like a deathless god.\na band of Phoenicians landed there. The famous sea-dogs,\nsharp bargainers too, the holds of their black ship\nbrimful with a hoard of flashy baubles. Now,\nmy father kept a Phoenician woman in his house,\nbeautiful, tall and skilled at weaving lovely things,\n470  and her rascal countrymen lusted to seduce her, yes,\nand lost no time —she was washing clothes when one of them\nwaylaid her beside their ship, in a long deep embrace\nthat can break a woman’s will, even the best alive.\nAnd then he asked her questions . . .\nher name, who was she, where did she come from?\nShe waved at once to my father’s high-roofed house —\n‘But I’m proud to hail from Sidon paved in bronze,’ she said,\n‘and Arybas was my father, a man who rolled in wealth.\nI was heading home from the fields when Taphian pirates\n480  snatched me away, and they shipped and sold me here\nto this man’s house. He paid a good stiff price!’\nThe sailor, her secret lover, lured her on:\n‘Well then, why don’t you sail back home with us? —\nsee your own high house, your father and mother there.\nThey’re still alive, and people say they’re rich!’\n‘Now there’s a tempting offer,’ she said in haste,\n‘if only you sailors here would swear an oath\nyou’ll land me safe at home without a scratch.’\nThose were her terms, and once they vowed to keep them,\n490  swore their oaths they’d never do her harm,\nthe woman hatched a plan: ‘Now not a word!\nLet none of your shipmates say a thing to me,\nmeeting me on the street or at the springs.\nSomeone might go running off to the house\nand tell the old king —he’d think the worst,\nclap me in cruel chains and find a way to kill you.\nSo keep it a secret, down deep, get on with buying\nyour home cargo, quickly. But once your holds\nare loaded up with goods, then fast as you can\n500  you send the word to me over there at the palace.\nI’ll bring you all the gold I can lay my hands on\nand something else I’ll give you in the bargain,\nfare for passage home . . .\nI’m nurse to my master’s son in the palace now —\nsuch a precious toddler, scampering round outside,\nalways at my heels. I’ll bring him aboard as well.\nWherever you sell him off, whatever foreign parts,\nhe’ll fetch you quite a price!’\nBargain struck,\nback the woman went to our lofty halls\n510  and the rovers stayed on with us one whole year,\nbartering, piling up big hoards in their hollow ship,\nand once their holds were loaded full for sailing\nthey sent a messenger, fast, to alert the woman.\nThis crafty bandit came to my father’s house,\ndangling a golden choker linked with amber beads,\nand while the maids at hall and my noble mother\nkept on fondling it —dazzled, feasting their eyes\nand making bids —he gave a quiet nod to my nurse,\nhe gave her the nod and slunk back to his ship.\n520  Grabbing my hand, she swept me through the house\nand there in the porch she came on cups and tables\nleft by the latest feasters, father’s men of council\njust gone off to the meeting grounds for full debate —\nand quick as a flash she snatched up three goblets,\ntucked them into her bosom, whisked them off\nand I tagged along, lost in all my innocence!\nThe sun sank, the roads of the world grew dark\nand both on the run, we reached the bay at once\nwhere the swift Phoenician ship lay set to sail.\n530  Handing us up on board, the crewmen launched out\non the foaming lanes and Zeus sent wind astern.\nSix whole days we sailed, six nights, nonstop\nand then, when the god brought on the seventh day,\nArtemis showering arrows came and shot the woman —\nheadfirst into the bilge she splashed like a diving tern\nand the crewmen heaved her body over, a nice treat\nfor the seals and fish, but left me all alone,\ncowering, sick at heart . . .\nUntil, at last,\nthe wind and current bore us on to Ithaca,\n540  here where Laertes bought me with his wealth.\nAnd so I first laid eyes on this good land.”\nAnd royal King Odysseus answered warmly,\n“Eumaeus, so much misery! You’ve moved my heart,\ndeeply, with your long tale —such pain, such sorrow.\nTrue, but look at the good fortune Zeus sends you,\nhand-in-hand with the bad. After all your toil\nyou reached the house of a decent, kindly man\nwho gives you all you need in meat and drink —\nhe’s seen to that, I’d say —\n550  it’s a fine life you lead! Better than mine . . .\nI’ve been drifting through cities up and down the earth\nand now I’ve landed here.”\nSo guest and host\nconfided through the night until they slept,\na little at least, not long.\nDawn soon rose and took her golden throne.\nTelemachus and his shipmates raised the coasts of home,\nthey struck sail and lowered the mast, smartly,\nrowed her into a mooring under oars.\nOut went the bow-stones, cables fast astern,\n560  the crew themselves swung out in the breaking surf,\nthey got a meal together and mixed some ruddy wine.\nAnd once they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nclear-headed Telemachus gave the men commands:\n“Pull our black ship round to the city now —\nI’m off to my herdsmen and my farms. By nightfall,\nonce I’ve seen to my holdings, I’ll be down in town.\nIn the morning I’ll give you wages for the voyage,\na handsome feast of meat and hearty wine.”\nThe seer Theoclymenus broke in quickly,\n570  “Where shall I go, dear boy? Of all the lords\nin rocky Ithaca, whose house shall I head for now?\nOr do I go straight to your mother’s house and yours?”\n“Surely in better times,” discreet Telemachus replied,\n“I would invite you home. Our hospitality never fails\nbut now, I fear, it could only serve you poorly.\nI’ll be away, and mother would never see you.\nShe rarely appears these days,\nwhat with those suitors milling in the hall;\nshe keeps to her upper story, weaving at her loom.\n580  But I’ll mention someone else you might just visit:\nEurymachus, wise Polybus’ fine, upstanding son.\nHe’s the man of the hour! Our island people\nlook on him like a god —the prince of suitors,\nhottest to wed my mother, seize my father’s powers.\nBut god knows —Zeus up there in his bright Olympus —\nwhether or not before that wedding day arrives\nhe’ll bring the day of death on all their heads!”\nAt his last words a bird flew past on the right,\na hawk, Apollo’s wind-swift herald —tight in his claws\n590  a struggling dove, and he ripped its feathers out\nand they drifted down to earth between the ship\nand the young prince himself . . .\nThe prophet called him aside, clear of his men,\nand grasped his hand, exclaiming, “Look, Telemachus,\nthe will of god just winged that bird on your right!\nWhy, the moment I saw it, here before my eyes,\nI knew it was a sign. No line more kingly than yours\nin all of Ithaca —yours will reign forever!”\n“If only, friend,”\nalert Telemachus answered, “all you say comes true!\n600  You’d soon know my affection, know my gifts.\nAny man you meet would call you blest.”\nHe turned to a trusted friend and said, “Piraeus,\nson of Clytius, you are the one who’s done my bidding,\nmore than all other friends who sailed with me to Pylos.\nPlease, take this guest of mine to your own house,\ntreat him kindly, host him with all good will\ntill I can come myself.”\n“Of course, Telemachus,”\nPiraeus the gallant spearman offered warmly:\n“Stay up-country just as long as you like.\n610  I’ll tend the man, he’ll never lack a lodging.”\nPiraeus boarded ship and told the crew\nto embark at once and cast off cables quickly —\nthey swung aboard and sat to the oars in ranks.\nTelemachus fastened rawhide sandals on his feet\nand took from the decks his rugged bronze-tipped spear.\nThe men cast off, pushed out and pulled for town\nas Telemachus ordered, King Odysseus’ son.\nThe prince strode out briskly,\nlegs speeding him on till he reached the farm\n620  where his great droves of pigs crowded their pens\nand the loyal swineherd often slept beside them,\nalways the man to serve his masters well."

    "text": "As dawn came into the lodge, the king and loyal swineherd\nset out breakfast, once they had raked the fire up\nand got the herdsmen off with droves of pigs.\nAnd now Telemachus . . .\nthe howling dogs went nuzzling up around him,\nnot a growl as he approached. From inside\nOdysseus noticed the pack’s quiet welcome,\nnoticed the light tread of footsteps too\nand turned to Eumaeus quickly, winged a word:\n10  “Eumaeus, here comes a friend of yours, I’d say.\nSomeone you know, at least. The pack’s not barking,\nmust be fawning around him. I can hear his footfall.”\nThe words were still on his lips when his own son\nstood in the doorway, there. The swineherd started up,\namazed, he dropped the bowls with a clatter —he’d been busy\nmixing ruddy wine. Straight to the prince he rushed\nand kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes,\nboth hands, as the tears rolled down his cheeks.\nAs a father, brimming with love, welcomes home\n20  his darling only son in a warm embrace —\nwhat pain he’s borne for him and him alone! —\nhome now, in the tenth year from far abroad,\nso the loyal swineherd hugged the beaming prince,\nhe clung for dear life, covering him with kisses, yes,\nlike one escaped from death. Eumaeus wept and sobbed,\nhis words flew from the heart: “You’re home, Telemachus,\nsweet light of my eyes! I never thought I’d see you again,\nonce you’d shipped to Pylos! Quick, dear boy, come in,\nlet me look at you, look to my heart’s content —\n30  under my own roof, the rover home at last.\nYou rarely visit the farm and men these days,\nalways keeping to town, as if it cheered you\nto see them there, that infernal crowd of suitors!”\n“Have it your way,” thoughtful Telemachus replied.\n“Dear old man, it’s all for you that I’ve come,\nto see you for myself and learn the news —\nwhether mother still holds out in the halls\nor some other man has married her at last,\nand Odysseus’ bed, I suppose, is lying empty,\nblanketed now with filthy cobwebs.”\n40                                         “Surely,”\nthe foreman of men responded, “she’s still waiting\nthere in your halls, poor woman, suffering so,\nher life an endless hardship . . .\nwasting away the nights, weeping away the days.”\nhe took the bronze spear from the boy, and Telemachus,\ncrossing the stone doorsill, went inside the lodge.\nAs he approached, his father, Odysseus, rose\nto yield his seat, but the son on his part\nwaved him back: “Stay where you are, stranger.\n50  I know we can find another seat somewhere,\nhere on our farm, and here’s the man to fetch it.”\nSo Odysseus, moving back, sat down once more,\nand now for the prince the swineherd strewed a bundle\nof fresh green brushwood, topped it off with sheepskin\nand there the true son of Odysseus took his place.\nEumaeus set before them platters of roast meat\nleft from the meal he’d had the day before;\nhe promptly served them bread, heaped in baskets,\nmixed their hearty wine in a wooden bowl\n60  and then sat down himself to face the king.\nThey reached for the good things that lay at hand,\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink\nTelemachus asked his loyal serving-man at last,\n“Old friend, where does this stranger come from?\nWhy did the sailors land him here in Ithaca?\nWho did they say they are?\nI hardly think he came this way on foot.”\nYou answered him, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“Here, my boy, I’ll tell you the whole true story.\n70  He hails from Crete’s broad land, he’s proud to say,\nbut he claims he’s drifted round through countless towns of men,\nroaming the earth . . . and so a god’s spun out his fate.\nHe just now broke away from some Thesprotian ship\nand came to my farm. I’ll put him in your hands,\nyou tend to him as you like.\nHe counts on you, he says, for care and shelter.”\n“Shelter? Oh Eumaeus,” Telemachus replied,\n“that word of yours, it cuts me to the quick!\nHow can I lend the stranger refuge in my house?\n80  I’m young myself. I can hardly trust my hands\nto fight off any man who rises up against me.\nThen my mother’s wavering, always torn two ways:\nwhether to stay with me and care for the household,\ntrue to her husband’s bed, the people’s voice as well,\nor leave at long last with the best man in Achaea\nwho courts her in the halls, who offers her the most.\nBut our new guest, since he’s arrived at your house,\nI’ll give him a shirt and cloak to wear, good clothing,\ngive him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet\n90  and send him off, wherever his heart desires.\nOr if you’d rather, keep him here at the farmstead,\ntend to him here, and I’ll send up the clothes\nand full rations to keep the man in food;\nhe’ll be no drain on you and all your men.\nBut I can’t let him go down and join the suitors.\nThey’re far too abusive, reckless, know no limits:\nthey’ll make a mockery of him —that would break my heart.\nIt’s hard for a man to win his way against a mob,\neven a man of iron. They are much too strong.”\n100    “Friend” —the long-enduring Odysseus stepped in —\n“surely it’s right for me to say a word at this point.\nMy heart, by god, is torn to pieces hearing this,\nboth of you telling how these reckless suitors,\nthere in your own house, against your will,\nplot your ruin —a fine young prince like you.\nTell me, though, do you let yourself be so abused\nor do people round about, stirred up by the prompting\nof some god, despise you? Or are your brothers at fault?\nBrothers a man can trust to fight beside him, true,\n110  no matter what deadly blood-feud rages on.\nWould I were young as you, to match my spirit now,\nor I were the son of great Odysseus, or the king himself\nreturned from all his roving —there’s still room for hope!\nThen let some foreigner lop my head off if I failed\nto march right into Odysseus’ royal halls\nand kill them all. And what if I went down,\ncrushed by their numbers —I, fighting alone?\nI’d rather die, cut down in my own house\nthan have to look on at their outrage day by day.\n120  Guests treated to blows, men dragging the serving-women\nthrough the noble house, exploiting them all, no shame,\nand the gushing wine swilled, the food squandered —\ngorging for gorging’s sake —\nand the courting game goes on, no end in sight!”\n“You’re right, my friend,” sober Telemachus agreed.\n“Now let me tell you the whole story, first to last.\nIt’s not that all our people have turned against me,\nkeen for a showdown. Nor have I any brothers at fault,\nbrothers a man can trust to fight beside him, true,\n130  no matter what deadly blood-feud rages on . . .\nZeus made our line a line of only sons.\nArcesius had only one son, Laertes,\nand Laertes had only one son, Odysseus,\nand I am Odysseus’ only son. He fathered me,\nhe left me behind at home, and from me he got no joy.\nSo now our house is plagued by swarms of enemies.\nAll the nobles who rule the islands round about,\nDulichion, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus too,\nand all who lord it in rocky Ithaca as well —\n140  down to the last man they court my mother,\nthey lay waste my house! And mother . . .\nshe neither rejects a marriage she despises\nnor can she bear to bring the courting to an end —\nwhile they continue to bleed my household white.\nSoon —you wait —they’ll grind me down as well!\nBut all lies in the lap of the great gods.\ngood old friend, go, quickly, to wise Penelope.\nTell her I’m home from Pylos safe and sound.\nI’ll stay on right here. But you come back\n150  as soon as you’ve told the news to her alone.\nNo other Achaean must hear —\nall too many plot to take my life.”\nyou assured your prince, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd.\n“I see your point —there’s sense in this old head.\nOne thing more, and make your orders clear.\nOn the same trip do I go and give the news\nto King Laertes too? For many years, poor man,\nheartsick for his son, he’d always keep an eye\non the farm and take his meals with the hired hands\n160  whenever he felt the urge to. Now, from the day\nyou sailed away to Pylos, not a sip or a bite\nhe’s touched, they say, not as he did before,\nand his eyes are shut to all the farmyard labors.\nHuddled over, groaning in grief and tears,\nhe wastes away —the man’s all skin and bones.”\n“So much the worse,” Telemachus answered firmly.\n“Leave him alone; though it hurts us now, we must.\nIf men could have all they want, free for the taking,\nI’d take first my father’s journey home. So,\n170  you go and give the message, then come back,\nno roaming over the fields to find Laertes.\nTell my mother to send her housekeeper,\nfast as she can, in secret —\nshe can give the poor old man the news.”\nThat roused Eumaeus. The swineherd grasped his sandals,\nstrapped them onto his feet and made for town.\nHis exit did not escape Athena’s notice . . .\nApproaching, closer, now she appeared a woman,\nbeautiful, tall and skilled at weaving lovely things.\n180  Just at the shelter’s door she stopped, visible to Odysseus\nbut Telemachus could not see her, sense her there —\nthe gods don’t show themselves to every man alive.\nOdysseus saw her, so did the dogs; no barking now,\nthey whimpered, cringing away in terror through the yard.\nShe gave a sign with her brows, Odysseus caught it,\nout of the lodge he went and past the high stockade\nand stood before the goddess. Athena urged him on:\n“Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, old campaigner,\nnow is the time, now tell your son the truth.\n190  Hold nothing back, so the two of you can plot\nthe suitors’ doom and then set out for town.\nI myself won’t lag behind you long —\nI’m blazing for a battle!”\nAthena stroked him with her golden wand.\nFirst she made the cloak and shirt on his body\nfresh and clean, then made him taller, supple, young,\nhis ruddy tan came back, the cut of his jawline firmed\nand the dark beard clustered black around his chin.\nHer work complete, she went her way once more\n200  and Odysseus returned to the lodge. His own son\ngazed at him, wonderstruck, terrified too, turning\nhis eyes away, suddenly —\nthis must be some god —\nand he let fly with a burst of exclamations:\n“Friend, you’re a new man —not what I saw before!\nYour clothes, they’ve changed, even your skin has changed —\nsurely you are some god who rules the vaulting skies!\nOh be kind, and we will give you offerings,\ngifts of hammered gold to warm your heart —\nspare us, please, I beg you!”\n“No, I am not a god,”\n210  the long-enduring, great Odysseus returned.\n“Why confuse me with one who never dies?\nNo, I am your father —\nthe Odysseus you wept for all your days,\nyou bore a world of pain, the cruel abuse of men.”\nAnd with those words Odysseus kissed his son\nand the tears streamed down his cheeks and wet the ground,\nthough before he’d always reined his emotions back.\nBut still not convinced that it was his father,\nTelemachus broke out, wild with disbelief,\n220  “No, you’re not Odysseus! Not my father!\nJust some spirit spellbinding me now —\nto make me ache with sorrow all the more.\nImpossible for a mortal to work such marvels,\nnot with his own devices, not unless some god\ncomes down in person, eager to make that mortal\nyoung or old —like that! Why, just now\nyou were old, and wrapped in rags, but now, look,\nyou seem like a god who rules the skies up there!”\n“Telemachus,” Odysseus, man of exploits, urged his son,\n230  “it’s wrong to marvel, carried away in wonder so\nto see your father here before your eyes.\nNo other Odysseus will ever return to you.\nThat man and I are one, the man you see . . .\nhere after many hardships,\nendless wanderings, after twenty years\nI have come home to native ground at last.\nMy changing so? Athena’s work, the Fighter’s Queen —\nshe has that power, she makes me look as she likes,\nnow like a beggar, the next moment a young man,\n240  decked out in handsome clothes about my body.\nIt’s light work for the gods who rule the skies\nto exalt a mortal man or bring him low.”\nOdysseus sat down again, and Telemachus threw his arms\naround his great father, sobbing uncontrollably\nas the deep desire for tears welled up in both.\nThey cried out, shrilling cries, pulsing sharper\nthan birds of prey —eagles, vultures with hooked claws —\nwhen farmers plunder their nest of young too young to fly.\nBoth men so filled with compassion, eyes streaming tears,\n250  that now the sunlight would have set upon their cries\nif Telemachus had not asked his father, all at once,\n“What sort of ship, dear father, brought you here? —\nIthaca, at last. Who did the sailors say they are?\nI hardly think you came back home on foot!”\nSo long an exile, great Odysseus replied,\n“Surely, my son, I’ll tell you the whole story now.\nPhaeacians brought me here, the famous sailors\nwho ferry home all men who reach their shores.\nThey sailed me across the sea in their swift ship,\n260  they set me down in Ithaca, sound asleep, and gave me\nglittering gifts —bronze and hoards of gold and robes.\nAll lie stowed in a cave, thanks to the gods’ help,\nand Athena’s inspiration spurred me here, now,\nso we could plan the slaughter of our foes.\nCome, give me the full tally of these suitors —\nI must know their numbers, gauge their strength.\nThen I’ll deploy this old tactician’s wits,\ndecide if the two of us can take them on,\nalone, without allies,\nor we should hunt reserves to back us up.”\n270                                              “Father,”\nclear-headed Telemachus countered quickly,\n“all my life I’ve heard of your great fame —\na brave man in war and a deep mind in counsel —\nbut what you say dumbfounds me, staggers imagination!\nHow on earth could two men fight so many and so strong?\nThese suitors are not just ten or twenty, they’re far more —\nyou count them up for yourself now, take a moment . . .\nFrom Dulichion, fifty-two of them, picked young men,\nsix servants in their troop; from Same, twenty-four,\n280  from Zacynthus, twenty Achaeans, nobles all,\nand the twelve best lords from Ithaca itself.\nMedon the herald’s with them, a gifted bard,\nand two henchmen, skilled to carve their meat.\nIf we pit ourselves against all these in the house,\nI fear the revenge you come back home to take\nwill recoil on our heads —a bitter, deadly blow.\nThink: can you come up with a friend-in-arms?\nSome man to fight beside us, some brave heart?”\n“Let me tell you,” the old soldier said,\n290  “bear it in mind now, listen to me closely.\nThink: will Athena flanked by Father Zeus\ndo for the two of us?\nOr shall I rack my brains for another champion?”\nTelemachus answered shrewdly, full of poise,\n“Two great champions, those you name, it’s true.\nOff in the clouds they sit\nand they lord it over gods and mortal men.”\n“Trust me,” his seasoned father reassured him,\n“they won’t hold off long from the cries and clash of battle,\n300  not when we and the suitors put our fighting strength\nto proof in my own halls! But now, with daybreak,\nhome you go and mix with that overbearing crowd.\nThe swineherd will lead me into the city later,\nlooking old and broken, a beggar once again.\nIf they abuse me in the palace, steel yourself,\nno matter what outrage I must suffer, even\nif they drag me through our house by the heels\nand throw me out or pelt me with things they hurl —\nyou just look on, endure it. Prompt them to quit\n310  their wild reckless ways, try to win them over\nwith friendly words. Those men will never listen,\nnow the day of doom is hovering at their heads.\nOne more thing. Take it to heart, I urge you.\nWhen Athena, Queen of Tactics, tells me it is time,\nI’ll give you a nod, and when you catch that signal\nround up all the deadly weapons kept in the hall,\nstow them away upstairs in a storeroom’s deep recess —\nall the arms and armor —and when the suitors miss them\nand ask you questions, put them off with a winning story:\n320  ‘I stowed them away, clear of the smoke. A far cry\nfrom the arms Odysseus left when he went to Troy,\nfire-damaged equipment, black with reeking fumes.\nAnd a god reminded me of something darker too.\nWhen you’re in your cups a quarrel might break out,\nyou’d wound each other, shame your feasting here\nand cast a pall on your courting.\nIron has powers to draw a man to ruin.’\nJust you leave\na pair of swords for the two of us, a pair of spears\nand a pair of oxhide bucklers right at hand so we\n330  can break for the weapons, seize them! Then Athena,\nZeus in his wisdom —they will daze the suitors’ wits.\nNow one last thing. Bear it in mind. You must.\nIf you are my own true son, born of my blood,\nlet no one hear that Odysseus has come home.\nDon’t let Laertes know, not Eumaeus either,\nnone in the household, not Penelope herself.\nYou and I alone will assess the women’s mood\nand we might test a few of the serving-men as well:\nwhere are the ones who still respect us both,\n340  who hold us in awe? And who shirk their duties? —\nslighting you because you are so young.”\n“Soon enough, father,” his gallant son replied,\n“you’ll sense the courage inside me, that I know —\nI’m hardly a flighty, weak-willed boy these days.\nBut I think your last plan would gain us nothing.\nReconsider, I urge you.\nYou’ll waste time, roaming around our holdings,\nprobing the fieldhands man by man, while the suitors\nsit at ease in our house, devouring all our goods —\n350  those brazen rascals never spare a scrap!\nBut I do advise you to sound the women out:\nwho are disloyal to you, who are guiltless?\nThe men —I say no to testing them farm by farm.\nThat’s work for later, if you have really seen\na sign from Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder.”\nNow as father and son conspired, shaping plans,\nthe ship that brought the prince and shipmates back\nfrom Pylos was just approaching Ithaca, home port.\nAs soon as they put in to the harbor’s deep bay\n360  they hauled the black vessel up onto dry land\nand eager deckhands bore away their gear\nand rushed the priceless gifts to Clytius’ house.\nBut they sent a herald on to Odysseus’ halls at once\nto give the news to thoughtful, cautious Penelope\nthat Telemachus was home —just up-country now\nbut he’d told his mates to sail across to port —\nso the noble queen would not be seized with fright\nand break down in tears. And now those two men met,\nherald and swineherd, both out on the same errand,\n370  to give the queen the news. But once they reached\nthe house of the royal king the herald strode up,\ninto the serving-women’s midst, and burst out,\n“Your beloved son, my queen, is home at last!”\nEumaeus though, bending close to Penelope,\nwhispered every word that her dear son\nentrusted him to say. Message told in full,\nhe left the halls and precincts, heading for his pigs.\nBut the news shook the suitors, dashed their spirits.\nOut of the halls they crowded, past the high-walled court\n380  and there before the gates they sat in council.\nPolybus’ son Eurymachus opened up among them:\n“Friends, what a fine piece of work he’s carried off!\nTelemachus —what insolence —and we thought his little jaunt\nwould come to grief! Up now, launch a black ship,\nthe best we can find —muster a crew of oarsmen,\nrow the news to our friends in ambush, fast,\nbring them back at once.”\nAnd just then —\nhe’d not quite finished when Amphinomus,\nwheeling round in his seat,\n390  saw their vessel moored in the deep harbor,\ntheir comrades striking sail and hoisting oars.\nHe broke into heady laughter, called his friends:\n“No need for a message now. They’re home, look there!\nSome god gave them the news, or they saw the prince’s ship\ngo sailing past and failed to overtake her.”\nRising, all trooped down to the water’s edge\nas the crew hauled the vessel up onto dry land\nand the hot-blooded hands bore off their gear.\nThen in a pack they went to the meeting grounds,\n400  suffering no one else, young or old, to sit among them.\nEupithes’ son Antinous rose and harangued them all:\n“What a blow! See how the gods have saved this boy\nfrom bloody death? And our lookouts all day long,\nstationed atop the windy heights, kept watch,\nshift on shift; and once the sun went down\nwe’d never sleep the night ashore, never,\nalways aboard our swift ship, cruising till dawn,\npatrolling to catch Telemachus, kill him on the spot,\nand all the while some spirit whisked him home!\n410  So here at home we’ll plot his certain death:\nhe must never slip through our hands again,\nthat boy —while he still lives,\nI swear we’ll never bring our venture off.\nThe clever little schemer, he does have his skills,\nand the crowds no longer show us favor, not at all.\nSo act! before he can gather his people in assembly.\nHe’ll never give in an inch, I know, he’ll rise\nand rage away, shouting out to them all how we,\nwe schemed his sudden death but never caught him.\n420  Hearing of our foul play, they’ll hardly sing our praises.\nWhy, they might do us damage, run us off our lands,\ndrive us abroad to hunt for strangers’ shores.\nStrike first, I say, and kill him! —\nclear of town, in the fields or on the road.\nThen we’ll seize his estates and worldly goods,\ncarve them up between us, share and share alike.\nBut as for his palace, let his mother keep it,\nshe and the man she weds.\nThere’s my plan.\nIf you find it offensive, if you want him\n430  living on —in full command of his patrimony —\ngather here no more then, living the life of kings,\nconsuming all his wealth. Each from his own house\nmust try to win her, showering her with gifts.\nThen she can marry the one who offers most,\nthe man marked out by fate to be her husband.”\nThat brought them all to a hushed, stunned silence\ntill Amphinomus rose to have his say among them —\nthe noted son of Nisus, King Aretias’ grandson,\nthe chief who led the suitors from Dulichion,\n440  land of grass and grains,\nand the man who pleased Penelope the most,\nthanks to his timely words and good clear sense.\nConcerned for their welfare now, he stood and argued:\n“Friends, I’ve no desire to kill Telemachus, not I —\nit’s a terrible thing to shed the blood of kings.\nWait, sound out the will of the gods —that first.\nIf the decrees of mighty Zeus commend the work,\nI’ll kill the prince myself and spur on all the rest.\nIf the gods are against it, then I say hold back!”\n450    So Amphinomus urged, and won them over.\nThey rose at once, returned to Odysseus’ palace,\nentered and took their seats on burnished chairs.\nBut now an inspiration took the discreet Penelope\nto face her suitors, brutal, reckless men.\nThe queen had heard it all . . .\nhow they plotted inside the house to kill her son.\nThe herald Medon told her —he’d overheard their schemes.\nAnd so, flanked by her ladies, she descended to the hall.\nThat luster of women, once she reached her suitors,\n460  drawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,\npaused now where a column propped the sturdy roof\nand rounding on Antinous, cried out against him:\n“You, Antinous! Violent, vicious, scheming —\nyou, they say, are the best man your age in Ithaca,\nbest for eloquence, counsel. You’re nothing of the sort!\nMadman, why do you weave destruction for Telemachus? —\nshow no pity to those who need it? —those over whom\nalmighty Zeus stands guard. It’s wrong, unholy, yes,\nweaving death for those who deserve your mercy!\n470  Don’t you know how your father fled here once?\nA fugitive, terrified of the people, up in arms\nagainst him because he’d joined some Taphian pirates\nout to attack Thesprotians, sworn allies of ours.\nThe mobs were set to destroy him, rip his life out,\ndevour his vast wealth to their heart’s content,\nbut Odysseus held them back, he kept their fury down.\nAnd this is the man whose house you waste, scot-free,\nwhose wife you court, whose son you mean to kill —\nyou make my life an agony! Stop, I tell you,\n480  stop all this, and make the rest stop too!”\nBut Polybus’ son Eurymachus tried to calm her:\n“Wise Penelope, daughter of Icarius, courage!\nDisabuse yourself of all these worries now.\nThat man is not alive —\nhe never will be, he never can be born —\nwho’ll lift a hand against Telemachus, your son,\nnot while I walk the land and I can see the light.\nI tell you this —so help me, it will all come true —\nin an instant that man’s blood will spurt around my spear!\n490  My spear, since time and again Odysseus dandled me\non his knees, the great raider of cities fed me\nroasted meat and held the red wine to my lips.\nSo to me your son is the dearest man alive,\nand I urge the boy to have no fear of death,\nnot from the suitors at least.\nWhat comes from the gods —there’s no escaping that.”\nEncouraging, all the way, but all the while\nplotting the prince’s murder in his mind . . .\nThe queen, going up to her lofty well-lit room,\n500  fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,\ntill watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep.\nReturning just at dusk to Odysseus and his son,\nthe loyal swineherd found they’d killed a yearling pig\nand standing over it now were busy cooking supper.\nBut Athena had approached Laertes’ son Odysseus,\ntapped him with her wand and made him old again.\nShe dressed him in filthy rags too, for fear Eumaeus,\nrecognizing his master face-to-face, might hurry\nback to shrewd Penelope, blurting out the news\n510  and never hide the secret in his heart.\nTelemachus was the first to greet the swineherd:\n“Welcome home, my friend! What’s the talk in town?\nAre the swaggering suitors back from ambush yet —\nor still waiting to catch me coming home?”\nYou answered the prince, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“I had no time to go roaming all through town,\ndigging round for that. My heart raced me on\nto get my message told and rush back here.\nBut I met up with a fast runner there,\n520  sent by your crew, a herald,\nfirst to tell your mother all the news.\nAnd this I know, I saw with my own eyes —\nI was just above the city, heading home,\nclambering over Hermes’ Ridge, when I caught sight\nof a trim ship pulling into the harbor, loaded down\nwith a crowd aboard her, shields and two-edged spears.\nI think they’re the men you’re after —I’m not sure.”\nAt that the young prince Telemachus smiled,\nglancing toward his father, avoiding Eumaeus’ eyes.\n530  with the roasting done, the meal set out, they ate well\nand no one’s hunger lacked a proper share of supper.\nWhen they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nthey remembered bed and took the gift of sleep."

    "text": "When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nTelemachus strapped his rawhide sandals to his feet\nand the young prince, the son of King Odysseus,\npicked up the rugged spear that fit his grip\nand striking out for the city, told his swineherd,\n“I’m off to town, old friend, to present myself to mother.\nShe’ll never stop her bitter tears and mourning,\nwell I know, till she sees me face-to-face.\nAnd for you I have some orders —\n10  take this luckless stranger to town, so he can beg\nhis supper there, and whoever wants can give the man\nsome crumbs and a cup to drink. How can I put up with\nevery passerby? My mind’s weighed down with troubles.\nIf the stranger resents it, all the worse for him.\nI like to tell the truth and tell it plainly.”\n“My friend,\nsubtle Odysseus broke in, “I’ve no desire, myself,\nto linger here. Better that beggars cadge their meals\nin town than in the fields. Some willing soul\nwill see to my needs. I’m hardly fit, at my age,\n20  to keep to a farm and jump to a foreman’s every order.\nGo on then. This man will take me, as you’ve told him,\nonce I’m warm from the fire and the sun’s good and strong.\nLook at the clothing on my back —all rags and tatters.\nI’m afraid the frost at dawn could do me in,\nand town, you say, is a long hard way from here.”\nAt that Telemachus strode down through the farm\nin quick, firm strides, brooding death for the suitors.\nAnd once he reached his well-constructed palace,\npropping his spear against a sturdy pillar\n30  and crossing the stone threshold, in he went.\nHis old nurse was the first to see him, Eurycleia,\njust spreading fleeces over the carved, inlaid chairs.\nTears sprang to her eyes, she rushed straight to the prince\nas the other maids of great Odysseus flocked around him,\nhugged him warmly, kissed his head and shoulders.\nNow down from her chamber came discreet Penelope,\nlooking for all the world like Artemis or golden Aphrodite —\nbursting into tears as she flung her arms around her darling son\nand kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes and sobbed,\n40  “You’re home, Telemachus!” —words flew from her heart —\n“sweet light of my eyes! I never thought I’d see you again,\nonce you shipped to Pylos —against my will, so secret,\nout for news of your dear father. Quick tell me,\ndid you catch sight of the man —meet him —what?”\n“Please, mother,” steady Telemachus replied,\n“don’t move me to tears, don’t stir the heart inside me.\nI’ve just escaped from death. Sudden death.\nNo. Bathe now, put on some fresh clothes,\ngo up to your own room with your serving-women,\n50  pray, and promise the gods a generous sacrifice\nto bring success, if Zeus will ever grant us\nthe hour of our revenge. I myself am off\nto the meeting grounds to summon up a guest\nwho came with me from abroad when I sailed home.\nI sent him on ahead with my trusted crew.\nI told Piraeus to take him to his house,\ntreat him well, host him with all good will\ntill I could come myself.”\nWords to the mark\nthat left his mother silent . . .\n60  She bathed now, put on some fresh clothes,\nprayed, and promised the gods a generous sacrifice\nto bring success, if Zeus would ever grant\nthe hour of their revenge.\nSpear in hand,\nTelemachus strode on through the hall and out,\nand a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels.\nAnd Athena lavished a marvelous splendor on the prince\nso the people all gazed in wonder as he came forward.\nThe swaggering suitors clustered, milling round him,\nwelcome words on their lips, and murder in their hearts.\n70  But he gave them a wide berth as they came crowding in\nand there where Mentor sat, Antiphus, Halitherses too —\nhis father’s loyal friends from days gone by —\nhe took his seat as they pressed him with their questions.\nAnd just then Piraeus the gallant spearman approached,\nleading the stranger through the town and out onto\nthe meeting grounds. Telemachus, not hanging back,\nwent right up to greet Theoclymenus, his guest,\nbut Piraeus spoke out first: “Quickly now,\nTelemachus, send some women to my house\n80  to retrieve the gifts that Menelaus gave you.”\n“Wait, Piraeus,” wary Telemachus cautioned,\n“we’ve no idea how all of this will go.\nIf the brazen suitors cut me down in the palace —\noff guard —and carve apart my father’s whole estate,\nI’d rather you yourself, or one of his friends here,\nkeep those gifts and get some pleasure from them.\nBut if I can bring down slaughter on that crew,\nyou send the gifts to my house —we’ll share the joy.”\nTheir plans made, he led the wayworn stranger home\n90  and once they reached the well-constructed palace,\nspreading out their cloaks on a chair or bench,\ninto the burnished tubs they climbed and bathed.\nWhen women had washed them, rubbed them down with oil\nand drawn warm fleece and shirts around their shoulders,\nout of the baths they stepped and sat on high-backed chairs.\nA maid brought water soon in a graceful golden pitcher\nand over a silver basin tipped it out\nso they might rinse their hands,\nthen pulled a gleaming table to their side.\n100  A staid housekeeper brought on bread to serve them,\nappetizers aplenty too, lavish with her bounty.\nPenelope sat across from her son, beside a pillar,\nleaning back on a low chair and winding finespun yarn.\nThey reached out for the good things that lay at hand\nand when they’d put aside desire for food and drink,\nthe queen, for all her composure, said at last,\n“Telemachus, I’m going back to my room upstairs\nand lie down on my bed . . .\nthat bed of pain my tears have streaked, year in,\n110  year out, from the day Odysseus sailed away to Troy\nwith Atreus’ two sons.\nBut you, you never had the heart —\nbefore those insolent suitors crowd back to the house —\nto tell me clearly about your father’s journey home,\nif you’ve heard any news.”\n“Of course, mother,”\nthoughtful Telemachus reassured her quickly,\n“I will tell you the whole true story now.\nWe sailed to Pylos, to Nestor, the great king,\nand he received me there in his lofty palace,\ntreated me well and warmly, yes, as a father treats\n120  a long-lost son just home from voyaging, years abroad:\nsuch care he showered on me, he and his noble sons.\nBut of strong, enduring Odysseus, dead or alive,\nhe’s heard no news, he said, from any man on earth.\nHe sent me on to the famous spearman Atrides Menelaus,\non with a team of horses drawing a bolted chariot.\nAnd there I saw her, Helen of Argos —all for her\nAchaeans and Trojans suffered so much hardship,\nthanks to the gods’ decree . . .\nThe lord of the warcry, Menelaus, asked at once\n130  what pressing need had brought me to lovely Lacedaemon,\nand when I told him the whole story, first to last,\nthe king burst out, ‘How shameful! That’s the bed\nof a brave man of war they’d like to crawl inside,\nthose spineless, craven cowards!\nWeak as the doe that beds down her fawns\nin a mighty lion’s den —her newborn sucklings —\nthen trails off to the mountain spurs and grassy bends\nto graze her fill, but back the lion comes to his own lair\nand the master deals both fawns a ghastly bloody death,\n140  just what Odysseus will deal that mob —ghastly death.\nAh if only —Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo —\nthat man who years ago in the games at Lesbos\nrose to Philomelides’ challenge, wrestled him,\npinned him down with one tremendous throw\nand the Argives roared with joy . . .\nif only that Odysseus sported with those suitors,\na blood wedding, a quick death would take the lot!\nBut about the things you’ve asked me, so intently,\nI’ll skew and sidestep nothing, not deceive you, ever.\n150  Of all he told me —the Old Man of the Sea who never lies —\nI’ll hide or hold back nothing, not a single word.\nHe said he’d seen Odysseus on an island,\nground down in misery, off in a goddess’ house,\nthe nymph Calypso, who holds him there by force.\nHe has no way to voyage home to his own native land,\nno trim ships in reach, no crew to ply the oars\nand send him scudding over the sea’s broad back.’\nSo Menelaus, the famous spearman, told me.\nMy mission accomplished, back I came at once,\n160  and the gods sent me a stiff following wind\nthat sped me home to the native land I love.”\nHis reassurance stirred the queen to her depths\nand the godlike seer Theoclymenus added firmly,\n“Noble lady, wife of Laertes’ son, Odysseus,\nMenelaus can have no perfect revelations;\nmark my words —I will make you a prophecy,\nquite precise, and I’ll hold nothing back.\nI swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods,\nby this table of hospitality here, my host,\n170  by Odysseus’ hearth where I have come for help —\nI swear Odysseus is on native soil, here and now!\nPoised or on the prowl, learning of these rank crimes\nhe’s sowing seeds of ruin for all your suitors.\nSo clear, so true, that bird-sign I saw\nas I sat on the benched ship\nand sounded out the future to the prince!”\n“If only, my friend,” reserved Penelope exclaimed,\n“everything you say would come to pass!\nYou’d soon know my affection, know my gifts.\n180  Any man you meet would call you blest.”\nAnd so the three confided in the halls\nwhile all the suitors, before Odysseus’ palace,\namused themselves with discus and long throwing spears,\nout on the leveled grounds, free and easy as always,\nfull of swagger. When the dinner-hour approached\nand sheep came home from pastures near and far,\ndriven in by familiar drovers,\nMedon called them all, their favorite herald,\nalways present at their meals: “My young lords,\n190  now you’ve played your games to your hearts’ content,\ncome back to the halls so we can fix your supper.\nNothing’s better than dining well on time!”\nThey came at his summons, rising from the games\nand now, bustling into the well-constructed palace,\nflinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench,\nthey butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats,\nfull-grown hogs and a young cow from the herd,\npreparing for their feast.\nAt the same time\nthe king and his loyal swineherd geared to leave\n200  the country for the town. Eumaeus, foreman of men,\nset things in motion: “Friend, I know you’re keen\non going down to town today, just as my master bid,\nthough I’d rather you stay here to guard the farm.\nBut I prize the boy, I fear he’ll blame me later —\na dressing-down from your master’s hard to bear.\nSo off we go now. The shank of the day is past.\nYou’ll find it colder with nightfall coming on.”\n“I know, I see your point,” the crafty man replied.\n“There’s sense in this old head. So let’s be off.\n210  And from now on, you lead me all the way.\nJust give me a stick to lean on,\nif you have one ready-cut. You say the road\nis treacherous, full of slips and slides.”\nhe flung his beggar’s sack across his shoulders —\ntorn and tattered, slung from a fraying rope.\nEumaeus gave him a staff that met his needs.\nThen the two moved out, leaving behind them\ndogs and herdsmen to stay and guard the farm.\nAnd so the servant led his master toward the city,\n220  looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar\nhunched on a stick, his body wrapped in shameful rags . . .\nDown over the rugged road they went till hard by town\nthey reached the stone-rimmed fountain running clear\nwhere the city people came and drew their water.\nIthacus built it once, with Neritus and Polyctor.\nRound it a stand of poplar thrived on the dank soil,\nall in a nestling ring, and down from a rock-ledge overhead\nthe cold water splashed, and crowning the fountain\nrose an altar-stone erected to the nymphs,\n230  where every traveler paused and left an offering.\nHere Dolius’ son, Melanthius, crossed their path,\nherding his goats with a pair of drovers’ help,\nthe pick of his flocks to make the suitors’ meal.\nAs soon as he saw them there he broke into a flood\nof brutal, foul abuse that made Odysseus’ blood boil.\n“Look!” —he sneered —“one scum nosing another scum along,\ndirt finds dirt by the will of god —it never fails!\nWretched pig-boy, where do you take your filthy swine,\nthis sickening beggar who licks the pots at feasts?\n240  Hanging round the doorposts, rubbing his back,\nscavenging after scraps,\nno hero’s swords and cauldrons, not for him.\nHand him over to me —I’ll teach him to work a farm,\nmuck out my stalls, pitch feed to the young goats;\nwhey to drink will put some muscle on his hams!\nOh no, he’s learned his lazy ways too well,\nhe’s got no itch to stick to good hard work,\nhe’d rather go scrounging round the countryside,\nbegging for crusts to stuff his greedy gut!\n250  Let me tell you —so help me it’s the truth —\nif he sets foot in King Odysseus’ royal palace,\nsalvos of footstools flung at his head by all the lords\nwill crack his ribs as he runs the line of fire through the house!”\nWild, reckless taunts —and just as he passed Odysseus\nthe idiot lurched out with a heel and kicked his hip\nbut he couldn’t knock the beggar off the path,\nhe stood his ground so staunchly. Odysseus was torn . . .\nshould he wheel with his staff and beat the scoundrel senseless? —\nor hoist him by the midriff, split his skull on the rocks?\n260  He steeled himself instead, his mind in full control.\nBut Eumaeus glared at the goatherd, cursed him to his face,\nthen lifted up his hands and prayed his heart out:\n“O nymphs of the fountain, daughters of Zeus —\nif Odysseus ever burned you the long thighs\nof lambs or kids, covered with rich fat,\nnow bring my prayer to pass!\nLet that man come back —some god guide him now!\nHe’d toss to the winds the flashy show you make,\nMelanthius, so cocksure —always strutting round the town\n270  while worthless fieldhands leave your flocks a shambles!”\n“Listen to him!” the goatherd shouted back.\n“All bark and no bite from the vicious mutt!\nOne fine day I’ll ship him out in a black lugger,\nmiles from Ithaca —sell him off for a good stiff price!\nJust let Apollo shoot Telemachus down with his silver bow,\ntoday in the halls, or the suitors snuff his life out —\nas sure as I know the day of the king’s return\nis blotted out, the king is worlds away!”\nWith his parting shot he left them trudging on\n280  and went and reached the royal house in no time.\nSlipping in, he took his seat among the suitors,\nfacing Eurymachus, who favored him the most.\nThe carvers set before him his plate of meat,\na staid housekeeper brought the man his bread.\nAnd now at last the king and loyal swineherd,\ndrawing near the palace, halted just outside\nas the lyre’s rippling music drifted round them —\nPhemius, striking up a song for assembled guests —\nand the master seized his servant’s hand, exclaiming,\n290  “Friend, what a noble house! Odysseus’ house, it must be!\nNo mistaking it —you could tell it among a townful, look.\nOne building linked to the next, and the courtyard wall\nis finished off with a fine coping, the double doors\nare battle-proof —no man could break them down!\nI can tell a crowd is feasting there in force —\nsmell the savor of roasts . . . the ringing lyre, listen,\nthe lyre that god has made the friend of feasts.”\n“An easy guess,” you said, Eumaeus, swineherd,\n“for a man as keen as you at every turn.\n300  Put heads together. What do we do next?\nEither you’re the first one into the palace —\nmix with the suitors, leave me where I am.\nOr if you like, stay put, and I’ll go first myself.\nDon’t linger long. Someone might spot you here outside,\nknock you down or pelt you. Mark my words. Take care.”\nThe man who’d borne long years abroad replied,\n“Well I know. Remember? There’s sense in this old head.\nYou go in, you first, while I stay here behind.\nStones and blows and I are hardly strangers.\n310  My heart is steeled by now,\nI’ve had my share of pain in the waves and wars.\nAdd this to the total. Bring the trial on.\nBut there’s no way to hide the belly’s hungers —\nwhat a curse, what mischief it brews in all our lives!\nJust for hunger we rig and ride our long benched ships\non the barren salt sea, speeding death to enemies.”\nNow, as they talked on, a dog that lay there\nlifted up his muzzle, pricked his ears . . .\nIt was Argos, long-enduring Odysseus’ dog\n320  he trained as a puppy once, but little joy he got\nsince all too soon he shipped to sacred Troy.\nIn the old days young hunters loved to set him\ncoursing after the wild goats and deer and hares.\nBut now with his master gone he lay there, castaway,\non piles of dung from mules and cattle, heaps collecting\nout before the gates till Odysseus’ serving-men\ncould cart it off to manure the king’s estates.\nInfested with ticks, half-dead from neglect,\nhere lay the hound, old Argos.\n330  But the moment he sensed Odysseus standing by\nhe thumped his tail, nuzzling low, and his ears dropped,\nthough he had no strength to drag himself an inch\ntoward his master. Odysseus glanced to the side\nand flicked away a tear, hiding it from Eumaeus,\ndiverting his friend in a hasty, offhand way:\n“Strange, Eumaeus, look, a dog like this,\nlying here on a dung-hill . . .\nwhat handsome lines! But I can’t say for sure\nif he had the running speed to match his looks\n340  or he was only the sort that gentry spoil at table,\nshow-dogs masters pamper for their points.”\nYou told the stranger, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“Here —it’s all too true —here’s the dog of a man\nwho died in foreign parts. But if he had now\nthe form and flair he had in his glory days —\nas Odysseus left him, sailing off to Troy —\nyou’d be amazed to see such speed, such strength.\nNo quarry he chased in the deepest, darkest woods\ncould ever slip this hound. A champion tracker too!\n350  Ah, but he’s run out of luck now, poor fellow . . .\nhis master’s dead and gone, so far from home,\nand the heartless women tend him not at all. Slaves,\nwith their lords no longer there to crack the whip,\nlose all zest to perform their duties well. Zeus,\nthe Old Thunderer, robs a man of half his virtue\nthe day the yoke clamps down around his neck.”\nWith that he entered the well-constructed palace,\nstrode through the halls and joined the proud suitors.\nBut the dark shadow of death closed down on Argos’ eyes\n360  the instant he saw Odysseus, twenty years away.\nNow Prince Telemachus, first by far to note\nthe swineherd coming down the hall, nodded briskly,\ncalled and waved him on. Eumaeus, glancing about,\npicked up a handy stool where the carver always sat,\nslicing meat for the suitors feasting through the house.\nHe took and put it beside the prince’s table, facing him,\nstraddled it himself as a steward set a plate of meat\nbefore the man and served him bread from trays.\nRight behind him came Odysseus, into his own house,\n370  looking for all the world like an old and broken beggar\nhunched on a stick, his body wrapped in shameful rags.\nJust in the doorway, just at the ashwood threshold,\nthere he settled down . . .\nleaning against the cypress post a master joiner\nplaned smooth and hung with a plumb line years ago.\nTelemachus motioned the swineherd over now,\nand choosing a whole loaf from a fine wicker tray\nand as much meat as his outstretched hands could hold,\nhe said, “Now take these to the stranger, tell him too\n380  to make the rounds of the suitors, beg from one and all.\nBashfulness, for a man in need, is no great friend.”\nAnd Eumaeus did his bidding, went straight up\nto the guest and winged a greeting: “Here, stranger,\nPrince Telemachus sends you these, and tells you too\nto make the rounds of the suitors, beg from one and all.\nBashfulness for a beggar, he says, is no great friend.”\n“Powerful Zeus!” the crafty king responded,\n“grant that your prince be blest among mankind —\nand all his heart’s desires come to pass!”\n390    Taking the food in both hands, setting it down,\nspread out on his filthy sack before his feet,\nthe beggar fell to his meal\nas the singer raised a song throughout the house.\nOnce he’d supped and the stirring bard had closed,\nthe suitors broke into uproar down along the hall.\nAnd now Athena came to the side of Laertes’ royal son\nand urged him, “Go now, gather crusts from all the suitors,\ntest them, so we can tell the innocent from the guilty.”\nBut not even so would Athena save one man from death.\n400  Still, off he went, begging from each in turn,\ncircling left to right, reaching out his hand\nlike a beggar from the day that he was born.\nThey pitied him, gave him scraps, were puzzled too,\nasking each other, “Who is this?” “Where’s he from?”\nTill the goatherd Melanthius shouted out in their midst,\n“Listen to me, you lords who court our noble queen —\nI’ll tell you about the stranger. I’ve seen him before.\nI know for a fact the swineherd led him in,\nthough I have no idea who the fellow is\nor where he thinks he comes from.”\n410                                       At that\nAntinous wheeled on Eumaeus, lashing out at him:\n“Your highness, swineherd —why drag this to town?\nHaven’t we got our share of vagabonds to deal with,\ndisgusting beggars who lick the feasters’ plates?\nIsn’t it quite enough, these swarming crowds\nconsuming your master’s bounty —\nmust you invite this rascal in the bargain?”\nhighborn as you are,” you told the man, Eumaeus,\n“that was a mean low speech!\n420  Now who’d go out, who on his own hook —\nnot I —and ask a stranger in from nowhere\nunless he had some skills to serve the house?\nA prophet, a healer who cures disease, a worker in wood\nor even a god-inspired bard whose singing warms the heart —\nthey’re the ones asked in around the world. A beggar?\nWho’d invite a beggar to bleed his household white?\nYou, you of all the suitors are always roughest\non the servants of our king, on me most of all.\nNot that I care, no, so long as his queen,\n430  his wise queen, is still alive in the palace,\nPrince Telemachus too.”\n“Stop, Eumaeus,”\npoised Telemachus broke in quickly now,\n“don’t waste so much breath on Antinous here.\nIt’s just his habit to bait a man with abuse\nand spur the rest as well.”\nHe wheeled on the suitor,\nletting loose: “How kind you are to me, Antinous,\nkind as a father to his son! Encouraging me\nto send this stranger packing from my house\nwith a harsh command! I’d never do it. God forbid.\n440  Take and give to the beggar. I don’t grudge it —\nI’d even urge you on. No scruples now,\nnever fear your gifts will upset my mother\nor any servant in King Odysseus’ royal house.\nBut no such qualm could enter that head of yours,\nbent on feeding your own face, not feeding strangers!”\nAntinous countered the young prince in kind:\n“So high and mighty, Telemachus —such unbridled rage!\nIf all the suitors gave him the sort of gift I’ll give,\nthe house would be rid of him for three whole months!”\n450  With that, from under his table he seized the stool\nthat propped his smooth feet as he reveled on —\njust lifting it into view . . .\nBut as for the rest,\nall gave to the beggar, filled his sack with handouts,\nbread and meat. And Odysseus seemed at the point\nof getting back to his doorsill,\ndone with testing suitors, home free himself\nwhen he stopped beside Antinous, begging face-to-face:\n“Give me a morsel, friend. You’re hardly the worst\nAchaean here, it seems. The noblest one, in fact.\n460  You look like a king to me!\nSo you should give a bigger crust than the rest\nand I will sing your praises all across the earth.\nI too once lived in a lofty house that men admired;\nrolling in wealth, I’d often give to a vagabond like myself,\nwhoever he was, whatever need had brought him to my door.\nAnd crowds of servants I had, and lots of all it takes\nto live the life of ease, to make men call you rich.\nBut Zeus ruined it all —god’s will, no doubt —\nwhen he shipped me off with a roving band of pirates\n470  bound for Egypt, a long hard sail, to wreck my life.\nThere in the Nile delta I moored our ships of war.\nGod knows I ordered my trusty crews to stand by,\njust where they were, and guard the anchored fleet\nand I sent a patrol to scout things out from higher ground.\nBut swept away by their own reckless fury, the crew went berserk —\nthey promptly began to plunder the lush Egyptian farms,\ndragged off the women and children, killed the men.\nOutcries reached the city in no time —stirred by shouts\nthe entire town came streaming down at the break of day,\n480  filling the river plain with chariots, ranks of infantry\nand the gleam of bronze. Zeus who loves the lightning\nflung down murderous panic on all my men-at-arms —\nno one dared to stand his ground and fight,\ndisaster ringed us round from every quarter.\nDroves of my men they hacked down with swords,\nled off the rest alive, to labor for them as slaves.\nMyself? They passed me on to a stranger come their way,\nto ship me to Cyprus —Iasus’ son Dmetor it was,\nwho ruled Cyprus then with an iron fist.\n490  And from there I sailed to Ithaca,\njust as you see me now, ground down by pain and sorrow —”\n“Good god almighty!” Antinous cut the beggar short.\n“What spirit brought this pest to plague our feast?\nBack off! Into the open, clear of my table, or you,\nyou’ll soon land in an Egypt, Cyprus, to break your heart!\nWhat a brazen, shameless beggar! Scrounging food\nfrom each man in turn, and look at their handouts,\nreckless, never a qualm, no holding back, not\nwhen making free with the next man’s goods —\neach one’s got plenty here.”\n500                               “Pity, pity,”\nthe wry Odysseus countered, drawing away.\n“No sense in your head to match your handsome looks.\nYou’d grudge your servant a pinch of salt from your own larder,\nyou who lounge at the next man’s board but lack the heart\nto tear a crust of bread and hand it on to me,\nthough there’s god’s plenty here.”\nBoiling over\nAntinous gave him a scathing look and let fly,\n“Now you won’t get out of the hall unscarred, I swear,\nnot after such a filthy string of insults!”\nhe seized the stool and hurled it —\n510                                    Square in the back\nit struck Odysseus, just under the right shoulder\nbut he stood up against it —steady as a rock,\nunstaggered by Antinous’ blow —just shook his head,\nsilent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work.\nBack he went to the doorsill, crouched, and setting down\nhis sack about to burst, he faced the suitors, saying,\n“Hear me out, you lords who court the noble queen,\nI must say what the heart inside me urges.\nThere’s nothing to groan about, no hurt, when a man\n520  takes a blow as he fights to save his own possessions,\ncattle or shining flocks. But Antinous struck me\nall because of my good-for-nothing belly —that,\nthat curse that makes such pain for us poor men.\nBut if beggars have their gods and Furies too,\nlet Antinous meet his death before he meets his bride!”\n“Enough, stranger!” Antinous volleyed back.\n“Sit there and eat in peace —or go get lost! Or else,\nfor the way you talk, these young men will hale you\nup and down the halls by your hands or feet\nuntil you’re skinned alive!”\n530                               Naked threats —\nbut the rest were outraged, even those brash suitors.\nOne would say to another, “Look, Antinous,\nthat was a crime, to strike the luckless beggar!”\n“Your fate is sealed if he’s some god from the blue.”\n“And the gods do take on the look of strangers\ndropping in from abroad —”\n“Disguised in every way\nas they roam and haunt our cities, watching over us —”\n“All our foul play, all our fair play too!”\nSo they warned, but Antinous paid no heed.\n540  And the anguish welled up in Telemachus’ breast\nfor the blow his father took, yet he let no tears\ngo rolling down his face —he just shook his head,\nsilent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work.\nBut then, when cautious Queen Penelope heard\nhow Antinous struck the stranger, there in the halls,\nshe cried out, with her serving-women round her,\n“May Apollo the Archer strike you just as hard!”\nAnd her housekeeper Eurynome added quickly,\n“If only our prayers were granted —\n550  then not one of the lot would live to see\nDawn climb her throne tomorrow!”\n“Dear old woman,”\nalert Penelope replied, “they’re all hateful,\nplotting their vicious plots. But Antinous\nis the worst of all —he’s black death itself.\nHere’s this luckless stranger, wandering down\nthe halls and begging scraps —hard-pressed by need —\nand the rest all give the man his fill of food\nbut that one gives him a footstool\nhurled at his right shoulder, hits his back!”\n560    While she exclaimed among her household women,\nsitting there in her room, Odysseus bent to supper.\nPenelope called the swineherd in and gave instructions:\n“Go, good Eumaeus, tell the stranger to come at once.\nI’d like to give him a warm welcome, ask the man\nif he’s heard some news about my gallant husband\nor seen him in the flesh . . .\nHe seems like one who’s roved around the world.”\n“My queen,” you answered, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“if only the lords would hold their peace a moment!\n570  Such stories he tells —he’d charm you to your depths.\nThree nights, three days I kept him in my shelter;\nI was the first the fellow stumbled onto,\nfleeing from some ship. But not even so\ncould he bring his tale of troubles to an end.\nYou know how you can stare at a bard in wonder —\ntrained by the gods to sing and hold men spellbound —\nhow you can long to sit there, listening, all your life\nwhen the man begins to sing. So he charmed my heart,\nI tell you, huddling there beside me at my fire.\n580  He and Odysseus’ father go way back, he says,\nsworn friends, and the stranger hails from Crete\nwhere the stock of old King Minos still lives on,\nand from Crete he made his way, racked by hardship,\ntumbling on like a rolling stone until he turned up here.\nHe swears he’s heard of Odysseus —just in reach,\nin rich Thesprotian country —still alive,\nladen with treasure, heading home at last!”\nthe cautious queen responded, “call him here\nso he can tell me his own tale face-to-face.\n590  Our friends can sit at the gates or down the halls\nand play their games, debauched to their hearts’ content.\nWhy not? Their own stores, their bread and seasoned wine,\nlie intact at home; food for their serving-men alone.\nBut they, they infest our palace day and night,\nthey butcher our cattle, our sheep, our fat goats,\nfeasting themselves sick, swilling our glowing wine\nas if there’s no tomorrow —all of it, squandered.\nNo, there is no man like Odysseus in command\nto drive this curse from the house. Dear god,\n600  if only Odysseus came back home to native soil now,\nhe and his son would avenge the outrage of these men —like that!”\nAt her last words Telemachus shook with a lusty sneeze\nlike a thunderclap resounding up and down the halls.\nThe queen was seized with laughter, calling out\nto Eumaeus winged words: “Quickly, go!\nBring me this stranger now, face-to-face!\nYou hear how my son sealed all I said with a sneeze?\nSo let death come down with grim finality on these suitors —\none and all —not a single man escape his sudden doom!\n610  And another thing. Mark my words, I tell you.\nIf I’m convinced that all he says is true,\nI’ll dress him in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes.”\nOff the swineherd went, following her instructions,\nmade his way to the stranger’s side and winged a word:\n“Old friend —our queen, wise Penelope, summons you,\nthe prince’s mother! The spirit moves her now,\nheartsick as she is,\nto ask a question or two about her husband.\nAnd if she’s convinced that all you say is true,\n620  she’ll dress you in shirt and cloak. That’s what you need,\nthat most of all now. Bread you can always beg\naround the country, fill your belly well —\nthey’ll give you food, whoever has a mind to.”\n“Gladly, Eumaeus,” the patient man replied,\n“I’ll tell her the whole truth and nothing but,\nIcarius’ daughter, your wise queen Penelope.\nI know all about that man . . .\nit’s been my lot to suffer what he’s suffered.\nBut I fear the mob’s abuse, those rough young bucks,\n630  their pride and violence hit the iron skies!\nJust now that scoundrel —as I went down the halls,\nharming no one —up and dealt me a jolting blow,\nand who would raise a hand to save me? Telemachus?\nAnyone else? No one. So tell Penelope now,\nanxious as she may be, to wait in the halls\nuntil the sun goes down. Then she can ask me\nall she likes about her husband’s journey home.\nBut let her give me a seat close by the fire.\nThe clothes on my back are tatters. Well you know —\n640  you are the first I begged for care and shelter.”\nBack the swineherd went, following his instructions.\nPenelope, just as he crossed her threshold, broke out,\n“Didn’t you bring him? What’s in the vagrant’s mind?\nFear of someone? Embarrassed by something else,\nhere in the house? Is the fellow bashful?\nA bashful man will make a sorry beggar.”\nYou answered your queen, Eumaeus, loyal swineherd,\n“He talks to the point —he thinks as the next man would\nwho wants to dodge their blows, that brutal crew.\n650  He tells you to wait here till the sun goes down.\nIt’s better for you, my queen. Then you can talk\nwith the man in private, hear the stranger’s news.”\n“Nobody’s fool, that stranger,” wise Penelope said,\n“he sees how things could go. Surely no men on earth\ncan match that gang for reckless, deadly schemes.”\nSo she agreed, and now, mission accomplished,\nback the loyal swineherd went to mix with the suitors.\nMoving next to the prince, he whispered a parting word,\ntheir heads close together so no one else could hear.\n660  “Dear boy, I must be off, to see to the pigs\nand the whole farm —your living, mine as well.\nYou’re the one to tend to all things here.\nLook out for your own skin first,\ndo take care, you mustn’t come to grief.\nCrowds of your own countrymen plot your death —\nlet Zeus wipe out the lot before they kill us all!”\n“Right you are, old friend,” the canny prince replied.\n“Now off you go, once you’ve had your supper.\nBut come back bright and early,\n670  bring some good sound boars for slaughter. Yes,\nI’ll tend to all things here, I and the deathless gods.”\nAnd the swineherd sat down again on his polished stool\nand once he’d supped and drunk to his heart’s content,\nback he went to his pigs, leaving the royal precincts\nstill filled with feasters, all indulging now\nin the joys of dance and song.\nThe day was over. Dusk was falling fast."

    "text": "Now along came this tramp, this public nuisance\nwho used to scrounge a living round the streets of Ithaca —\nnotorious for his belly, a ravenous, bottomless pit\nfor food and drink, but he had no pith, no brawn,\ndespite the looming hulk that met your eyes.\nArnaeus was his name,\nso his worthy mother called him at birth,\nbut all the young men called him Irus for short\nbecause he’d hustle messages at any beck and call.\n10  Well he came by to rout the king from his own house\nand met Odysseus now with a rough, abusive burst:\n“Get off the porch, you old goat, before I haul you\noff by the leg! Can’t you see them give me the wink,\nall of them here, to drag you out —and so I would\nbut I’ve got some pangs of conscience. Up with you, man,\nor before you know it, we’ll be trading blows!”\nA killing look,\nand the wily old soldier countered, “Out of your mind?\nWhat damage have I done you? What have I said?\nI don’t grudge you anything,\n20  not if the next man up and gives you plenty.\nThis doorsill is big enough for the both of us —\nyou’ve got no call to grudge me what’s not yours.\nYou’re another vagrant, just like me, I’d say,\nand it lies with the gods to make us rich or poor. So,\nkeep your fists to yourself, don’t press your luck, don’t rile me,\nor old as I am, I’ll bloody your lip, splatter your chest\nand buy myself some peace and quiet for tomorrow.\nI doubt you’ll ever come lumbering back again\nto the halls of Laertes’ royal son Odysseus.”\n30    “Look who’s talking!” the beggar rumbled in anger.\n“How this pot-bellied pig runs off at the mouth —\nlike an old crone at her oven!\nWell I’ve got a knock-out blow in store for him —\nI’ll batter the tramp with both fists, crack every tooth\nfrom his jaws, I’ll litter the ground with teeth\nlike a rogue sow’s, punished for rooting corn!\nBelt up —so the lords can see us fight it out.\nHow can you beat a champion half your age?”\nTongue-lashing each other, tempers flaring,\n40  there on the polished sill before the lofty doors.\nAnd Antinous, that grand prince, hearing them wrangle,\nbroke into gloating laughter, calling out to the suitors,\n“Friends, nothing like this has come our way before —\nwhat sport some god has brought the palace now!\nThe stranger and Irus, look,\nthey’d battle it out together, fists flying.\nCome, let’s pit them against each other —fast!”\nAll leapt from their seats with whoops of laughter,\nclustering round the pair of ragged beggars there\n50  as Eupithes’ son Antinous planned the contest.\n“Quiet, my fine friends. Here’s what I propose.\nThese goat sausages sizzling here in the fire —\nwe packed them with fat and blood to have for supper.\nNow, whoever wins this bout and proves the stronger,\nlet that man step up and take his pick of the lot!\nWhat’s more, from this day on he feasts among us —\nno other beggar will we allow inside\nto cadge his meals from us!”\nThey all cheered\nbut Odysseus, foxy veteran, plotted on . . .\n60  “Friends, how can an old man, worn down with pain,\nstand up to a young buck? It’s just this belly of mine,\nthis trouble-maker, tempts me to take a licking.\nSo first, all of you swear me a binding oath:\ncome, not one of you steps in for Irus here,\nstrikes me a foul blow to pull him through\nand lays me in the dust.”\nAnd at that\nthey all mouthed the oath that he required,\nand once they vowed they’d never interfere,\nPrince Telemachus drove the matter home:\n70  “Stranger, if your spine and fighting pride\nprompt you to go against this fellow now,\nhave no fear of any suitor in the pack —\nwhoever fouls you will have to face a crowd.\nCount on me, your host. And two lords back me up,\nAntinous and Eurymachus —both are men of sense.”\nThey all shouted approval of the prince\nas Odysseus belted up, roping his rags around his loins,\nbaring his big rippling thighs —his boxer’s broad shoulders,\nhis massive chest and burly arms on full display\n80  as Athena stood beside him,\nfleshing out the limbs of the great commander . . .\nDespite their swagger, the suitors were amazed,\ngaping at one another, trading forecasts:\n“Irus will soon be ironed out for good!”\n“He’s in for the beating he begged for all along.”\n“Look at the hams on that old-timer —”\n“Just under his rags!”\nEach outcry jolted Irus to the core —too late.\nThe servants trussed his clothes up, dragged him on,\nthe flesh on his body quaking now with terror.\n90  Antinous rounded on him, flinging insults:\n“You, you clumsy ox, you’re better off dead\nor never born at all, if you cringe at him,\nparalyzed with fear of an old, broken hulk,\nground down by the pains that hound his steps.\nMark my word —so help me I’ll make it good —\nif that old relic whips you and wins the day,\nI’ll toss you into a black ship and sail you off\nto Echetus, the mainland king who wrecks all men alive!\nHe’ll lop your nose and ears with his ruthless blade,\n100  he’ll rip your privates out by the roots, he will,\nand serve them up to his dogs to bolt down raw!”\nThat threat shook his knees with a stronger fit\nbut they hauled him into the ring. Both men put up their fists —\nwith the seasoned fighter Odysseus deeply torn now . . .\nshould he knock him senseless, leave him dead where he dropped\nor just stretch him out on the ground with a light jab?\nAs he mulled things over, that way seemed the best:\na glancing blow, the suitors would not detect him.\nThe two men squared off —\nand Irus hurled a fist\n110  at Odysseus’ right shoulder as he came through\nwith a hook below the ear, pounding Irus’ neck,\nsmashing the bones inside —\nsuddenly red blood\ncame spurting out of his mouth, and headlong down\nhe pitched in the dust, howling, teeth locked in a grin,\nfeet beating the ground —\nand the princely suitors,\nflinging their hands in the air, died laughing.\nGrabbing him by the leg, Odysseus hauled him\nthrough the porch, across the yard to the outer gate,\nheaped him against the courtyard wall, sitting slumped,\n120  stuck his stick in his hand and gave him a parting shot:\n“Now hold your post —play the scarecrow to all the pigs and dogs!\nBut no more lording it over strangers, no more playing\nthe beggar-king for you, you loathsome fool,\nor you’ll bring down something worse around your neck!”\nHe threw his beggar’s sack across his shoulders —\ntorn and tattered, slung from a fraying rope —\nthen back he went to the sill and took his seat.\nThe suitors ambled back as well, laughing jauntily,\ntoasting the beggar warmly now, those proud young blades,\n130  one man egging the other on: “Stranger, friend, may Zeus\nand the other deathless gods fill up your sack with blessings!”\n“All your heart desires!”\n“You’ve knocked him out of action,\nthat insatiable tramp —”\n“That parasite on the land!”\n“Ship him off to Echetus, fast —the mainland king\nwho wrecks all men alive!”\nWelcome words\nand a lucky omen too —Odysseus’ heart leapt up.\nAntinous laid before him a generous goat sausage,\nbubbling fat and blood. Amphinomus took two loaves\nfrom the wicker tray and set them down beside him,\n140  drank his health in a golden cup and said,\n“Cheers, old friend, old father,\nsaddled now as you are with so much trouble —\nhere’s to your luck, great days from this day on!”\nAnd the one who knew the world replied at length,\n“Amphinomus, you seem like a man of good sense to me.\nJust like your father —at least I’ve heard his praises,\nNisus of Dulichion, a righteous man, and rich.\nYou’re his son, they say, you seem well-spoken, too.\nSo I will tell you something. Listen. Listen closely.\n150  Of all that breathes and crawls across the earth,\nour mother earth breeds nothing feebler than a man.\nSo long as the gods grant him power, spring in his knees,\nhe thinks he will never suffer affliction down the years.\nBut then, when the happy gods bring on the long hard times,\nbear them he must, against his will, and steel his heart.\nOur lives, our mood and mind as we pass across the earth,\nturn as the days turn . . .\nas the father of men and gods makes each day dawn.\nI too seemed destined to be a man of fortune once\n160  and a wild wicked swath I cut, indulged my lust for violence,\nstaking all on my father and my brothers.\nLook at me now.\nAnd so, I say, let no man ever be lawless all his life,\njust take in peace what gifts the gods will send.\nbut here I see you suitors plotting your reckless work,\ncarving away at the wealth, affronting the loyal wife\nof a man who won’t be gone from kin and country long.\nI say he’s right at hand —and may some power save you,\nspirit you home before you meet him face-to-face\nthe moment he returns to native ground!\n170  Once under his own roof, he and your friends,\nbelieve you me, won’t part till blood has flowed.”\nhe poured out honeyed wine to the gods and drank deeply,\nthen restored the cup to the young prince’s hands.\nAmphinomus made his way back through the hall,\nhis heart sick with anguish, shaking his head,\nfraught with grave forebodings . . .\nbut not even so could he escape his fate.\nEven then Athena had bound him fast to death\nat the hands of Prince Telemachus and his spear.\n180  Now back he went to the seat that he’d left empty.\nBut now the goddess Athena with her glinting eyes\ninspired Penelope, Icarius’ daughter, wary, poised,\nto display herself to her suitors, fan their hearts,\ninflame them more, and make her even more esteemed\nby her husband and her son than she had been before.\nForcing a laugh, she called her maid: “Eurynome,\nmy spirit longs —though it never did till now —\nto appear before my suitors, loathe them as I do.\nI’d say a word to my son too, for his own good,\n190  not to mix so much with that pernicious crowd,\nso glib with their friendly talk\nbut plotting wicked plots they’ll hatch tomorrow.”\n“Well said, my child,” the old woman answered,\n“all to the point. Go to the boy and warn him now,\nhold nothing back. But first you should bathe yourself,\ngive a gloss to your face. Don’t go down like that —\nyour eyes dimmed, your cheeks streaked with tears.\nIt makes things worse, this grieving on and on.\nYour son’s now come of age —your fondest prayer\n200  to the deathless gods, to see him wear a beard.”\n“Eurynome,” discreet Penelope objected,\n“don’t try to coax me, care for me as you do,\nto bathe myself, refresh my face with oils.\nWhatever glow I had died long ago . . .\nthe gods of Olympus snuffed it out that day\nmy husband sailed away in the hollow ships.\nBut please, have Autonoë and Hippodamia come\nand support me in the hall. I’ll never brave\nthose men alone. I’d be too embarrassed.”\n210    Now as the old nurse bustled through the house\nto give the women orders, call them to the queen,\nthe bright-eyed goddess thought of one more thing.\nShe drifted a sound slumber over Icarius’ daughter,\nback she sank and slept, her limbs fell limp and still,\nreclining there on her couch, all the while Athena,\nluminous goddess, lavished immortal gifts on her\nto make her suitors lose themselves in wonder . . .\nThe divine unguent first. She cleansed her cheeks,\nher brow and fine eyes with ambrosia smooth as the oils\n220  the goddess Love applies, donning her crown of flowers\nwhenever she joins the Graces’ captivating dances.\nShe made her taller, fuller in form to all men’s eyes,\nher skin whiter than ivory freshly carved, and now,\nAthena’s mission accomplished, off the bright one went\nas bare-armed maids came in from their own quarters,\nchattering all the way, and sleep released the queen.\nShe woke, touched her cheek with a hand, and mused,\n“Ah, what a marvelous gentle sleep, enfolding me\nin the midst of all my anguish! Now if only\n230  blessed Artemis sent me a death as gentle, now,\nthis instant —no more wasting away my life,\nmy heart broken in longing for my husband . . .\nHe had every strength,\nrising over his countrymen, head and shoulders.”\nThen, leaving her well-lit chamber, she descended,\nnot alone: two of her women followed close behind.\nThat radiant woman, once she reached her suitors,\ndrawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,\npaused now where a column propped the sturdy roof,\n240  with one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side.\nThe suitors’ knees went slack, their hearts dissolved in lust —\nall of them lifted prayers to lie beside her, share her bed.\nBut turning toward her son, she warned, “Telemachus,\nyour sense of balance is not what it used to be.\nWhen you were a boy you had much better judgment.\nNow that you’ve grown and reached your young prime\nand any stranger, seeing how tall and handsome you are,\nwould think you the son of some great man of wealth —\nnow your sense of fairness seems to fail you.\n250  Consider the dreadful thing just done in our halls —\nhow you let the stranger be so abused! Why,\nsuppose our guest, sitting here at peace,\nhere in our own house,\nwere hauled and badly hurt by such cruel treatment?\nYou’d be shamed, disgraced in all men’s eyes!”\n“Mother . . .” Telemachus paused, then answered.\n“I cannot fault your anger at all this.\nMy heart takes note of everything, feels it, too,\nboth the good and the bad —the boy you knew is gone.\n260  But how can I plan my world in a sane, thoughtful way?\nThese men drive me mad, hedging me round, right and left,\nplotting their lethal plots, and no one takes my side.\nStill, this battle between the stranger and Irus\nhardly went as the suitors might have hoped:\nthe stranger beat him down!\nIf only —Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo —\nthese gallants, now, this moment, here in our house,\nwere battered senseless, heads lolling, knees unstrung,\nsome sprawled in the courtyard, some sprawled outside!\n270  Slumped like Irus down at the front gates now,\nwhipped, and his head rolling like some drunk.\nHe can’t stand up on his feet and stagger home,\nwhatever home he’s got —the man’s demolished.”\nSo Penelope and her son exchanged their hopes\nas Eurymachus stepped in to praise the queen.\n“Ah, daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,\nif all the princes in Ionian Argos saw you now!\nWhat a troop of suitors would banquet in your halls\ntomorrow at sunrise! You surpass all women\n280  in build and beauty, refined and steady mind.”\n“Oh no, Eurymachus,” wise Penelope demurred,\n“whatever form and feature I had, what praise I’d won,\nthe deathless gods destroyed that day the Achaeans\nsailed away to Troy, my husband in their ships,\nOdysseus —if he could return to tend my life\nthe renown I had would only grow in glory.\nNow my life is torment . . .\nlook at the griefs some god has loosed against me!\nI’ll never forget the day he left this land of ours;\n290  he caught my right hand by the wrist and said, gently,\n‘Dear woman, I doubt that every Achaean under arms\nwill make it home from Troy, all safe and sound.\nThe Trojans, they say, are fine soldiers too,\nhurling javelins, shooting flights of arrows,\ncharioteers who can turn the tide —like that! —\nwhen the great leveler, War, brings on some deadlock.\nSo I cannot tell if the gods will sail me home again\nor I’ll go down out there, on the fields of Troy,\nbut all things here must rest in your control.\n300  Watch over my father and mother in the palace,\njust as now, or perhaps a little more,\nwhen I am far from home.\nBut once you see the beard on the boy’s cheek,\nyou wed the man you like, and leave your house behind.’\nSo my husband advised me then. Now it all comes true . . .\na night will come when a hateful marriage falls my lot —\nthis cursed life of mine! Zeus has torn away my joy.\nBut there’s something else that mortifies me now.\nYour way is a far cry from the time-honored way\n310  of suitors locked in rivalry, striving to win\nsome noble woman, a wealthy man’s daughter.\nThey bring in their own calves and lambs\nto feast the friends of the bride-to-be, yes,\nand shower her with gleaming gifts as well.\nThey don’t devour the woman’s goods scot-free.”\nStaunch Odysseus glowed with joy to hear all this —\nhis wife’s trickery luring gifts from her suitors now,\nenchanting their hearts with suave seductive words\nbut all the while with something else in mind.\n320  Eupithes’ son Antinous took her point at once.\n“Daughter of Icarius, sensible Penelope,\nwhatever gifts your suitors would like to bring,\naccept them. How ungracious to turn those gifts away!\nWe won’t go back to our own estates, or anywhere else,\ntill you have wed the man you find the best.”\nSo he proposed, and all the rest agreed.\nEach suitor sent a page to go and get a gift.\nAntinous’ man brought in a grand, resplendent robe,\nstiff with embroidery, clasped with twelve gold brooches,\n330  long pins that clipped into sheathing loops with ease.\nEurymachus’ man brought in a necklace richly wrought,\ngilded, strung with amber and glowing like the sun.\nEurydamas’ two men came with a pair of earrings,\nmulberry clusters dangling in triple drops\nwith a glint to catch the heart.\nFrom the halls of lord Pisander, Polyctor’s son,\na servant brought a choker, a fine, gleaming treasure.\nAnd so each suitor in turn laid on a handsome gift.\nThen the noble queen withdrew to her upper room,\n340  her file of waiting ladies close behind her,\nbearing the gorgeous presents in their arms.\nNow the suitors turned to dance and song,\nto the lovely beat and sway,\nwaiting for dusk to come upon them there . . .\nand the dark night came upon them, lost in pleasure.\nThey rushed to set up three braziers along the walls\nto give them light, piled them high with kindling,\nsere, well-seasoned, just split with an ax,\nand mixed in chips to keep the torches flaring.\n350  The maids of Odysseus, steady man, took turns\nto keep the fires up, but the king himself,\ndear to the gods and cunning to the core,\ngave them orders brusquely: “Maids of Odysseus,\nyour master gone so long —quick now, off you go\nto the room where your queen and mistress waits.\nSit with her there and try to lift her spirits,\ncombing wool in your hands or spinning yarn.\nBut I will trim the torches for all her suitors,\neven if they would like to revel on till Morning\n360  mounts her throne. They’ll never wear me down.\nI have a name for lasting out the worst.”\nthe women burst into laughter, glancing back and forth.\nFlushed with beauty, Melantho mocked him shamelessly —\nDolius was her father but Penelope brought her up;\nshe treated her like her own child and gave her toys\nto cheer her heart. But despite that, her heart\nfelt nothing for all her mistress’ anguish now.\nShe was Eurymachus’ lover, always slept with him.\nShe was the one who mocked her king and taunted,\n370  “Cock of the walk, did someone beat your brains out?\nWhy not go bed down at the blacksmith’s cozy forge?\nOr a public place where tramps collect? Why here —\nblithering on, nonstop,\nbold as brass in the face of all these lords?\nNo fear in your heart? Wine’s got to your wits? —\nor do you always play the fool and babble nonsense?\nLost your head, have you, because you drubbed that hobo Irus?\nYou wait —a better man than Irus will take you on,\nhe’ll box both sides of your skull with heavy fists\nand cart you from the palace gushing blood!”\n380                                               “You wait,\nyou bitch” —the hardened veteran flashed a killing look.\n“I’ll go straight to the prince with your foul talk.\nThe prince will chop you to pieces here and now!”\nHis fury sent the women fluttering off, scattering\ndown the hall with panic shaking every limb —\nthey knew he spoke the truth.\nBut he took up his post by the flaring braziers,\ntending the fires closely, looking after them all,\nthough the heart inside him stirred with other things,\n390  ranging ahead, now, to all that must be done . . .\nBut Athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors\nhold back now from their heart-rending insults —\nshe meant to make the anguish cut still deeper\ninto the core of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\nPolybus’ son Eurymachus launched in first,\nbaiting the king to give his friends a laugh:\n“Listen to me, you lords who court our noble queen!\nI simply have to say what’s on my mind. Look,\nsurely the gods have fetched this beggar here\n400  to Odysseus’ house. At least our torchlight seems\nto come from the sheen of the man’s own head —\nthere’s not a hair on his bald pate, not a wisp!”\nThen he wheeled on Odysseus, raider of cities:\n“Stranger, how would you like to work for me\nif I took you on —I’d give you decent wages —\npicking the stones to lay a tight dry wall\nor planting tall trees on the edge of my estate?\nI’d give you rations to last you year-round,\nclothes for your body, sandals for your feet.\n410  Oh no, you’ve learned your lazy ways too well,\nyou’ve got no itch to stick to good hard work,\nyou’d rather go scrounging round the countryside,\nbegging for crusts to stuff your greedy gut!”\n“Ah, Eurymachus,” Odysseus, master of many exploits,\nanswered firmly, “if only the two of us could go\nman-to-man in the labors of the field . . .\nIn the late spring, when the long days come round,\nout in the meadow, I swinging a well-curved scythe\nand you swinging yours —we’d test our strength for work,\n420  fasting right till dusk with lots of hay to mow.\nOr give us a team of oxen to drive, purebreds,\nhulking, ruddy beasts, both lusty with fodder,\npaired for age and pulling-power that never flags —\nwith four acres to work, the loam churning under the plow —\nyou’d see what a straight unbroken furrow I could cut you then.\nOr if Zeus would bring some battle on —out of the blue,\nthis very day —and give me a shield and two spears\nand a bronze helmet to fit this soldier’s temples,\nthen you’d see me fight where front ranks clash —\n430  no more mocking this belly of mine, not then.\nEnough. You’re sick with pride, you brutal fool.\nNo doubt you count yourself a great, powerful man\nbecause you sport with a puny crowd, ill-bred to boot.\nIf only Odysseus came back home and stood right here,\nin a flash you’d find those doors —broad as they are —\ntoo cramped for your race to safety through the porch!”\nThat made Eurymachus’ fury seethe and burst —\nhe gave the beggar a dark look and let fly, “You,\nyou odious —I’ll make you pay for your ugly rant!\n440  Bold as brass in the face of all these lords?\nNo fear in your heart? Wine’s got to your wits? —\nor do you always play the fool and babble nonsense?\nLost your head, have you, because you drubbed that hobo Irus?”\nAs he shouted out he seized a stool, but Odysseus,\nfearing the blow, crouched at Amphinomus’ knees\nas Eurymachus hurled and hit the wine-steward,\nclipping his right hand —\nhis cup dropped, clattered along the floor\nand flat on his back he went, groaning in the dust.\n450  The suitors broke into uproar through the shadowed halls,\nglancing at one another, trading angry outcries:\n“Would to god this drifter had dropped dead —”\n“Anywhere else before he landed here!”\n“Then he’d never have loosed such pandemonium.”\n“Now we’re squabbling over beggars!”\n“No more joy\nin the sumptuous feast . . .”\n“Now riot rules the day!”\nBut now Prince Telemachus dressed them down:\n“Fools, you’re out of your minds! No hiding it,\nfood and wine have gone to your heads. Some god\n460  has got your blood up. Come, now you’ve eaten well\ngo home to bed —when the spirit moves, that is.\nI, for one, I’ll drive no guest away.”\nSo he declared. And they all bit their lips,\namazed the prince could speak with so much daring.\nAt last Amphinomus rose to take the floor,\nthe noted son of Nisus, King Aretias’ grandson.\n“Fair enough, my friends; when a man speaks well\nwe have no grounds for wrangling, no cause for abuse.\nHands off the stranger! And any other servant\n470  in King Odysseus’ palace. Come, steward,\npour first drops for the god in every cup;\nlet’s make libations, then go home to bed.\nThe stranger? Leave him here in Odysseus’ halls\nand have his host, Telemachus, tend him well —\nit’s the prince’s royal house the man has reached.”\nSo he said. His proposal pleased them all.\nAnd gallant Mulius, a herald of Dulichion,\na friend-in-arms of lord Amphinomus too,\nmixed the men a bowl and, hovering closely,\n480  poured full rounds for all. They tipped cups\nto the blissful gods and then, libations made,\nthey drank the heady wine to their hearts’ content\nand went their ways to bed, each suitor to his house."

    "text": "That left the great Odysseus waiting in his hall\nas Athena helped him plot the slaughter of the suitors.\nHe turned at once to Telemachus, brisk with orders:\n“Now we must stow the weapons out of reach, my boy,\nall the arms and armor —and when the suitors miss them\nand ask you questions, put them off with a winning story:\n‘I stowed them away, clear of the smoke. A far cry\nfrom the arms Odysseus left when he went to Troy,\nfire-damaged equipment, black with reeking fumes.\n10  And a god reminded me of something darker too.\nWhen you’re in your cups a quarrel might break out,\nyou’d wound each other, shame your feasting here\nand cast a pall on your courting.\nIron has powers to draw a man to ruin.’ ”\nTelemachus did his father’s will at once,\ncalling out to his old nurse Eurycleia: “Quick,\ndear one, close the women up in their own quarters,\ntill I can stow my father’s weapons in the storeroom.\nSplendid gear, lying about, neglected, black with soot\n20  since father sailed away. I was only a boy then.\nNow I must safeguard them from the smoke.”\n“High time, child,” the loving nurse replied.\n“If only you’d bother to tend your whole house\nand safeguard all your treasures. Tell me,\nwho’s to fetch and carry the torch for you?\nYou won’t let out the maids who’d light your way.”\n“Our friend here will,” Telemachus answered coolly.\n“I won’t put up with a man who shirks his work,\nnot if he takes his ration from my stores,\n30  even if he’s miles away from home.”\nThat silenced the old nurse.\nShe barred the doors that led from the long hall —\nand up they sprang, Odysseus and his princely son,\nand began to carry off the helmets, studded shields\nand pointed spears, and Pallas Athena strode before them,\nlifting a golden lamp that cast a dazzling radiance round about.\n“Father,” Telemachus suddenly burst out to Odysseus,\n“oh what a marvel fills my eyes! Look, look there —\nall the sides of the hall, the handsome crossbeams,\n40  pinewood rafters, the tall columns towering —\nall glow in my eyes like flaming fire!\nSurely a god is here —\none of those who rule the vaulting skies!”\n“Quiet,” his father, the old soldier, warned him.\n“Get a grip on yourself. No more questions now.\nIt’s just the way of the gods who rule Olympus.\nOff you go to bed. I’ll stay here behind\nto test the women, test your mother too.\nShe in her grief will ask me everything I know.”\n50    Under the flaring torchlight, through the hall\nTelemachus made his way to his own bedroom now,\nwhere he always went when welcome sleep came on him.\nThere he lay tonight as well, till Dawn’s first light.\nThat left the great king still waiting in his hall\nas Athena helped him plot the slaughter of the suitors . . .\nNow down from her chamber came reserved Penelope,\nlooking for all the world like Artemis or golden Aphrodite.\nClose to the fire her women drew her favorite chair\nwith its whorls of silver and ivory, inlaid rings.\nThe craftsman who made it years ago, Icmalius,\nadded a footrest under the seat itself,\nmortised into the frame,\nand over it all was draped a heavy fleece.\nHere Penelope took her place, discreet, observant.\nThe women, arms bared, pressing in from their quarters,\ncleared away the tables, the heaped remains of the feast\nand the cups from which the raucous lords had drunk.\nRaking embers from the braziers onto the ground,\nthey piled them high again with seasoned wood,\nproviding light and warmth.\n70                               And yet again\nMelantho lashed out at Odysseus: “You still here? —\nyou pest, slinking around the house all night,\nleering up at the women?\nGet out, you tramp —be glad of the food you got —\nor we’ll sling a torch at you, rout you out at once!”\nA killing glance, and the old trooper countered,\n“What’s possessed you, woman? Why lay into me? Such abuse!\nJust because I’m filthy, because I wear such rags,\nroving round the country, living hand-to-mouth.\n80  But it’s fate that drives me on:\nthat’s the lot of beggars, homeless drifters.\nI too once lived in a lofty house that men admired;\nrolling in wealth, I’d often give to a vagabond like myself,\nwhoever he was, whatever need had brought him to my door.\nAnd crowds of servants I had, and lots of all it takes\nto live the life of ease, to make men call you rich.\nBut Zeus ruined it all —god’s will, no doubt.\nSo beware, woman, or one day you may lose it all,\nall your glitter that puts your work-mates in the shade.\n90  Or your mistress may just fly in a rage and dress you down\nor Odysseus may return —there’s still room for hope!\nOr if he’s dead as you think and never coming home,\nwell there’s his son, Telemachus . . .\nlike father, like son —thanks to god Apollo.\nNo women’s wildness here in the house escapes\nthe prince’s eye. He’s come of age at last.”\nSo he warned, and alert Penelope heard him,\nwheeled on the maid and tongue-lashed her smartly:\n“Make no mistake, you brazen, shameless bitch,\n100  none of your ugly work escapes me either —\nyou will pay for it with your life, you will!\nHow well you knew —you heard from my own lips —\nthat I meant to probe this stranger in our house\nand ask about my husband . . . my heart breaks for him.”\nShe turned to her housekeeper Eurynome and said,\n“Now bring us a chair and spread it soft with fleece,\nso our guest can sit and tell me his whole story\nand hear me out as well.\nI’d like to ask him questions, point by point.”\n110    Eurynome bustled off to fetch a polished chair\nand set it down and spread it soft with fleece.\nHere Odysseus sat, the man of many trials,\nas cautious Penelope began the conversation:\n“Stranger, let me start our questioning myself . . .\nWho are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?”\n“My good woman,” Odysseus, master of craft, replied,\n“no man on the face of the earth could find fault with you.\nYour fame, believe me, has reached the vaulting skies.\nFame like a flawless king’s who dreads the gods,\n120  who governs a kingdom vast, proud and strong —\nwho upholds justice, true, and the black earth\nbears wheat and barley, trees bow down with fruit\nand the sheep drop lambs and never fail and the sea\nteems with fish —thanks to his decent, upright rule,\nand under his sovereign sway the people flourish.\nSo then, here in your house, ask me anything else\nbut don’t, please, search out my birth, my land,\nor you’ll fill my heart to overflowing even more\nas I bring back the past . . .\n130  I am a man who’s had his share of sorrows.\nIt’s wrong for me, in someone else’s house,\nto sit here moaning and groaning, sobbing so —\nit makes things worse, this grieving on and on.\nOne of your maids, or you yourself, might scold me,\nthink it’s just the wine that had doused my wits\nand made me drown in tears.”\n“No, no, stranger,” wise Penelope demurred,\n“whatever form and feature I had, what praise I’d won,\nthe deathless gods destroyed that day the Achaeans\n140  sailed away to Troy, my husband in their ships,\nOdysseus —if he could return to tend my life\nthe renown I had would only grow in glory.\nNow my life is torment . . .\nlook at the griefs some god has loosed against me!\nAll the nobles who rule the islands round about,\nDulichion, Same, and wooded Zacynthus too,\nand all who lord it in sunny Ithaca itself —\nthey court me against my will, they lay waste my house.\nSo I pay no heed to strangers, suppliants at my door,\n150  not even heralds out on their public errands here —\nI yearn for Odysseus, always, my heart pines away.\nThey rush the marriage on, and I spin out my wiles.\nA god from the blue it was inspired me first\nto set up a great loom in our royal halls\nand I began to weave, and the weaving finespun,\nthe yarns endless, and I would lead them on: ‘Young men,\nmy suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more,\ngo slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until\nI can finish off this web . . .\n160  so my weaving won’t all fray and come to nothing.\nThis is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day\nwhen the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down.\nI dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me,\nyes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state\nwithout a shroud for cover.’\nMy very words,\nand despite their pride and passion they believed me.\nSo by day I’d weave at my great and growing web —\nby night, by the light of torches set beside me,\nI would unravel all I’d done. Three whole years\n170  I deceived them blind, seduced them with this scheme.\nThen, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on\nand the months waned and the long days came round once more,\nthen, thanks to my maids —the shameless, reckless creatures —\nthe suitors caught me in the act, denounced me harshly.\nSo I finished it off. Against my will. They forced me.\nAnd now I cannot escape a marriage, nor can I contrive\na deft way out. My parents urge me to tie the knot\nand my son is galled as they squander his estate —\nhe sees it all. He’s a grown man by now, equipped\n180  to tend to his own royal house and tend it well:\nZeus grants my son that honor . . .\nBut for all that —now tell me who you are.\nWhere do you come from? You’ve hardly sprung\nfrom a rock or oak like some old man of legend.”\nThe master improviser answered, slowly,\n“My lady . . . wife of Laertes’ son, Odysseus,\nwill your questions about my family never end?\nAll right then. Here’s my story. Even though\nit plunges me into deeper grief than I feel now.\n190  But that’s the way of the world, when one has been\nso far from home, so long away as I, roving over\nmany cities of men, enduring many hardships.\nmy story will tell you all you need to know.\nThere is a land called Crete . . .\nringed by the wine-dark sea with rolling whitecaps —\nhandsome country, fertile, thronged with people\nwell past counting —boasting ninety cities,\nlanguage mixing with language side-by-side.\nFirst come the Achaeans, then the native Cretans,\n200  hardy, gallant in action, then Cydonian clansmen,\nDorians living in three tribes, and proud Pelasgians last.\nCentral to all their cities is magnificent Cnossos,\nthe site where Minos ruled and each ninth year\nconferred with almighty Zeus himself. Minos,\nfather of my father, Deucalion, that bold heart.\nBesides myself Deucalion sired Prince Idomeneus,\nwho set sail for Troy in his beaked ships of war,\nescorting Atreus’ sons. My own name is Aethon.\nI am the younger-born;\n210  my older brother’s a better man than I am.\nNow, it was there in Cnossos that I saw him . . .\nOdysseus —and we traded gifts of friendship.\nA heavy gale had landed him on our coast,\ndriven him way off course, rounding Malea’s cape\nwhen he was bound for Troy. He anchored in Amnisus,\nhard by the goddess’ cave of childbirth and labor,\nthat rough harbor —barely riding out the storm.\nHe came into town at once, asking for Idomeneus,\nclaiming to be my brother’s close, respected friend.\n220  Too late. Ten or eleven days had already passed\nsince he set sail for Troy in his beaked ships.\nSo I took Odysseus back to my own house,\ngave him a hero’s welcome, treated him in style —\nstores in our palace made for princely entertainment.\nAs for his comrades, all who’d shipped with him,\nI dipped into public stock to give them barley,\nruddy wine and fine cattle for slaughter,\nbeef to their hearts’ content. A dozen days\nthey stayed with me there, those brave Achaeans,\n230  penned up by a North Wind so stiff that a man,\neven on dry land, could never keep his feet —\nsome angry spirit raised that blast, I’d say.\nThen on the thirteenth day the wind died down\nand they set sail for Troy.”\nFalsehoods all,\nbut he gave his falsehoods all the ring of truth.\nAs she listened on, her tears flowed and soaked her cheeks\nas the heavy snow melts down from the high mountain ridges,\nsnow the West Wind piles there and the warm East Wind thaws\nand the snow, melting, swells the rivers to overflow their banks —\n240  so she dissolved in tears, streaming down her lovely cheeks,\nweeping for him, her husband, sitting there beside her.\nOdysseus’ heart went out to his grief-stricken wife\nbut under his lids his eyes remained stock-still —\nthey might have been horn or iron —\nhis guile fought back his tears. And she,\nonce she’d had her fill of grief and weeping,\nturned again to her guest with this reply:\n“Now, stranger, I think I’ll test you, just to see\nif there in your house, with all his friends-in-arms,\n250  you actually entertained my husband as you say.\nCome, tell me what sort of clothing he wore,\nwhat cut of man was he?\nWhat of the men who followed in his train?”\n“Ah good woman,”\nOdysseus, the great master of subtlety, returned,\n“how hard it is to speak, after so much time\napart . . . why, some twenty years have passed\nsince he left my house and put my land behind him.\nEven so, imagine the man as I portray him —\nI can see him now.\nKing Odysseus . . .\n260  he was wearing a heavy woolen cape, sea-purple\nin double folds, with a golden brooch to clasp it,\ntwin sheaths for the pins, on the face a work of art:\na hound clenching a dappled fawn in its front paws,\nslashing it as it writhed. All marveled to see it,\nsolid gold as it was, the hound slashing, throttling\nthe fawn in its death-throes, hoofs flailing to break free.\nI noticed his glossy tunic too, clinging to his skin\nlike the thin glistening skin of a dried onion,\nsilky, soft, the glint of the sun itself.\n270  Women galore would gaze on it with relish.\nAnd this too. Bear it in mind, won’t you?\nI’ve no idea if Odysseus wore these things at home\nor a comrade gave him them as he boarded ship,\nor a host perhaps —the man was loved by many.\nThere were few Achaeans to equal him . . . and I?\nI gave him a bronze sword myself, a lined cloak,\nelegant, deep red, and a fringed shirt as well,\nand I saw him off in his long benched ship of war\nin lordly style.\nSomething else. He kept a herald\n280  beside him, a man a little older than himself.\nI’ll try to describe him to you, best I can.\nRound-shouldered he was, swarthy, curly-haired.\nHis name? Eurybates. And Odysseus prized him\nmost of all his men. Their minds worked as one.”\nHis words renewed her deep desire to weep,\nrecognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.\nBut as soon as she’d had her fill of tears and grief,\nPenelope turned again to her guest and said,\n“Now, stranger, much as I pitied you before,\n290  now in my house you’ll be my special friend,\nmy honored guest. I am the one, myself,\nwho gave him the very clothes that you describe.\nI brought them up from the storeroom, folded them neatly,\nfastened the golden brooch to adorn my husband,\nOdysseus —never again will I embrace him,\nstriding home to his own native land.\nA black day it was\nwhen he took ship to see that cursed city . . .\nDestroy, I call it —I hate to say its name!”\n300    “Ah my queen,” the man of craft assured her,\n“noble wife of Laertes’ son, Odysseus,\nravage no more your lovely face with tears\nor consume your heart with grieving for your husband.\nNot that I’d blame you, ever. Any woman will mourn\nthe bridegroom she has lost, lain with in love\nand borne his children too. Even though he\nwas no Odysseus —a man like a god, they say.\nBut dry your tears and take my words to heart.\nI will tell you the whole truth and hide nothing:\n310  I have heard that Odysseus now, at last, is on his way,\nhe’s just in reach, in rich Thesprotian country —\nthe man is still alive\nand he’s bringing home a royal hoard of treasure,\ngifts he won from the people of those parts.\nHis crew? He’s lost his crew and hollow ship\non the wine-dark waters off Thrinacia Island.\nZeus and Helios raged, dead set against Odysseus\nfor his men-at-arms had killed the cattle of the Sun,\nso down to the last hand they drowned in crashing seas.\n320  But not Odysseus, clinging tight to his ship’s keel —\nthe breakers flung him out onto dry land, on Scheria,\nthe land of Phaeacians, close kin to the gods themselves,\nand with all their hearts they prized him like a god,\nshowered the man with gifts, and they’d have gladly\nsailed him home unscathed. In fact Odysseus\nwould have been here beside you long ago\nbut he thought it the better, shrewder course\nto recoup his fortunes roving through the world.\nAt sly profit-turning there’s not a man alive\n330  to touch Odysseus. He’s got no rival there.\nSo I learned from Phidon, king of Thesprotia,\nwho swore to me as he poured libations in his house,\n‘The ship’s hauled down and the shipmates set to sail,\nto take Odysseus home to native land.’\nBut I . . .\nhe shipped me off before. A Thesprotian cutter\nchanced to be heading for Dulichion rich in wheat.\nBut he showed me all the treasure Odysseus had amassed,\nenough to last a man and ten generations of his heirs —\nso great the wealth stored up for him in the king’s vaults!\n340  But Odysseus, he made clear, was off at Dodona then\nto hear the will of Zeus that rustles forth\nfrom the god’s tall leafy oak: how should he return,\nafter all the years away, to his own beloved Ithaca,\nopenly or in secret?\nAnd so the man is safe,\nas you can see, and he’s coming home, soon,\nhe’s close, close at hand —\nhe won’t be severed long from kin and country,\nno, not now. I give you my solemn, binding oath.\nI swear by Zeus, the first, the greatest god —\n350  by Odysseus’ hearth, where I have come for help:\nall will come to pass, I swear, exactly as I say.\nTrue, this very month —just as the old moon dies\nand the new moon rises into life —Odysseus will return!”\n“If only, my friend,” reserved Penelope exclaimed,\n“everything you say would come to pass!\nYou’d soon know my affection, know my gifts.\nAny man you meet would call you blest.\nBut my heart can sense the way it all will go.\nOdysseus, I tell you, is never coming back,\n360  nor will you ever gain your passage home,\nfor we have no masters in our house like him\nat welcoming in or sending off an honored guest.\nOdysseus. There was a man, or was he all a dream?\nBut come, women, wash the stranger and make his bed,\nwith bedding, blankets and lustrous spreads to keep him warm\ntill Dawn comes up and takes her golden throne.\nThen, tomorrow at daybreak, bathe him well\nand rub him down with oil, so he can sit beside\nTelemachus in the hall, enjoy his breakfast there.\n370  And anyone who offends our guest beyond endurance —\nhe defeats himself; he’s doomed to failure here,\nno matter how raucously he raves and blusters on.\nFor how can you know, my friend, if I surpass\nall women in thoughtfulness and shrewd good sense,\nif I’d allow you to take your meals at hall\nso weatherbeaten, clad in rags and tatters?\nOur lives are much too brief . . .\nIf a man is cruel by nature, cruel in action,\nthe mortal world will call down curses on his head\n380  while he is alive, and all will mock his memory after death.\nBut then if a man is kind by nature, kind in action,\nhis guests will carry his fame across the earth\nand people all will praise him from the heart.”\n“Wait, my queen,” the crafty man objected,\n“noble wife of Laertes’ son, Odysseus —\nblankets and glossy spreads? They’re not my style.\nNot from the day I launched out in my long-oared ship\nand the snowy peaks of Crete went fading far astern.\nI’ll lie as I’ve done through sleepless nights before.\n390  Many a night I’ve spent on rugged beds afield,\nwaiting for Dawn to mount her lovely throne.\nNor do I pine for any footbaths either.\nOf all the women who serve your household here,\nnot one will touch my feet. Unless, perhaps,\nthere is some old retainer, the soul of trust,\nsomeone who’s borne as much as I have borne . . .\nI wouldn’t mind if she would touch my feet.”\n“Dear friend,”\nthe discreet Penelope replied, “never has any man\nso thoughtful —of all the guests in my palace\n400  come from foreign parts —been as welcome as you . . .\nso sensible, so apt, is every word you say.\nI have just such an old woman, seasoned, wise,\nwho carefully tended my unlucky husband, reared him,\ntook him into her arms the day his mother bore him —\nfrail as the woman is, she’ll wash your feet.\nUp with you now, my good old Eurycleia,\ncome and wash your master’s . . . equal in years.\nOdysseus must have feet and hands like his by now —\nhardship can age a person overnight.”\nAt that name\n410  the old retainer buried her face in both hands,\nburst into warm tears and wailed out in grief,\n“Oh my child, how helpless I am to help you now!\nHow Zeus despised you, more than all other men,\ngod-fearing man that you were . . .\nNever did any mortal burn the Old Thunderer\nsuch rich thighbones —offerings charred and choice —\nnever as many as you did, praying always to reach\na ripe old age and raise a son to glory. Now,\nyou alone he’s robbed of your home-coming day!\n420  Just so, the women must have mocked my king,\nfar away, when he’d stopped at some fine house —\njust as all these bitches, stranger, mock you here.\nAnd because you shrink from their taunts, their wicked barbs,\nyou will not let them wash you. The work is mine —\nIcarius’ daughter, wise Penelope, bids me now\nand I am all too glad. I will wash your feet,\nboth for my own dear queen and for yourself —\nyour sorrows wring my heart . . . and why?\nListen to me closely, mark my words.\n430  Many a wayworn guest has landed here\nbut never, I swear, has one so struck my eyes —\nyour build, your voice, your feet —you’re like Odysseus . . .\nto the life!”\n“Old woman,” wily Odysseus countered,\n“that’s what they all say who’ve seen us both.\nWe bear a striking resemblance to each other,\nas you have had the wit to say yourself.”\nThe old woman took up a burnished basin\nshe used for washing feet and poured in bowls\nof fresh cold water before she stirred in hot.\n440  Odysseus, sitting full in the firelight, suddenly\nswerved round to the dark, gripped by a quick misgiving —\nsoon as she touched him she might spot the scar!\nThe truth would all come out.\nBending closer\nshe started to bathe her master . . . then,\nin a flash, she knew the scar —\nthat old wound\nmade years ago by a boar’s white tusk when Odysseus\nwent to Parnassus, out to see Autolycus and his sons.\nThe man was his mother’s noble father, one who excelled\nthe world at thievery, that and subtle, shifty oaths.\n450  Hermes gave him the gift, overjoyed by the thighs\nof lambs and kids he burned in the god’s honor —\nHermes the ready partner in his crimes. Now,\nAutolycus once visited Ithaca’s fertile land,\nto find his daughter’s son had just been born.\nEurycleia set him down on the old man’s knees\nas he finished dinner, urging him, “Autolycus,\nyou must find a name for your daughter’s darling son.\nThe baby comes as the answer to her prayers.”\nmy daughter, and you, my son-in-law,” Autolycus replied,\n“give the boy the name I tell you now. Just as I\nhave come from afar, creating pain for many —\nmen and women across the good green earth —\nso let his name be Odysseus . . .\nthe Son of Pain, a name he’ll earn in full.\nAnd when he has come of age and pays his visit\nto Parnassus —the great estate of his mother’s line\nwhere all my treasures lie —I will give him enough\nto cheer his heart, then speed him home to you.”\nin time, Odysseus went to collect the splendid gifts.\n470  Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus warmed him in\nwith eager handclasps, hearty words of welcome.\nHis mother’s mother, Amphithea, hugged the boy\nand kissed his face and kissed his shining eyes.\nAutolycus told his well-bred sons to prepare\na princely feast. They followed orders gladly,\nherded an ox inside at once, five years old,\nskinned it and split the carcass into quarters,\ndeftly cut it in pieces, skewered these on spits,\nroasted all to a turn and served the portions out.\n480  So all day long till the sun went down they feasted,\nconsuming equal shares to their hearts’ content.\nThen when the sun had set and night came on\nthey turned to bed and took the gift of sleep.\nas young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\nthey all moved out for the hunt, hounds in the lead,\nAutolycus’ sons and Prince Odysseus in their ranks.\nClimbing Parnassus’ ridges, thick with timber,\nthey quickly reached the mountain’s windy folds\nand just as the sun began to strike the plowlands,\n490  rising out of the deep calm flow of the Ocean River,\nthe beaters came to a wooded glen, the hounds broke,\nhot on a trail, and right behind the pack they came,\nAutolycus’ sons —Odysseus out in front now,\npressing the dogs, brandishing high his spear\nwith its long shadow waving. Then and there\na great boar lay in wait, in a thicket lair so dense\nthat the sodden gusty winds could never pierce it,\nnor could the sun’s sharp rays invade its depths\nnor a downpour drench it through and through,\n500  so dense, so dark, and piled with fallen leaves.\nHere, as the hunters closed in for the kill,\ncrowding the hounds, the tramp of men and dogs\ncame drumming round the boar —he crashed from his lair,\nhis razor back bristling, his eyes flashing fire\nand charging up to the hunt he stopped, at bay —\nand Odysseus rushed him first,\nshaking his long spear in a sturdy hand,\nwild to strike but the boar struck faster,\nlunging in on the slant, a tusk thrusting up\n510  over the boy’s knee, gouging a deep strip of flesh\nbut it never hit the bone —\nOdysseus thrust and struck,\nstabbing the beast’s right shoulder —\na glint of bronze —\nthe point ripped clean through and down in the dust he dropped,\ngrunting out his breath as his life winged away.\nThe sons of Autolycus, working over Odysseus,\nskillfully binding up his open wound —\nthe gallant, godlike prince —\nchanted an old spell that stanched the blood\nand quickly bore him home to their father’s palace.\n520  There, in no time, Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus\nhealed him well and, showering him with splendid gifts,\nsped Odysseus back to his native land, to Ithaca,\na young man filled with joy. His happy parents,\nhis father and noble mother, welcomed him home\nand asked him of all his exploits, blow-by-blow:\nhow did he get that wound? He told his tale with style,\nhow the white tusk of a wild boar had gashed his leg,\nhunting on Parnassus with Autolycus and his sons . . .\nThat scar —\nas the old nurse cradled his leg and her hands passed down\n530  she felt it, knew it, suddenly let his foot fall —\ndown it dropped in the basin —the bronze clanged,\ntipping over, spilling water across the floor.\nJoy and torment gripped her heart at once,\ntears rushed to her eyes —voice choked in her throat\nshe reached for Odysseus’ chin and whispered quickly,\n“Yes, yes! you are Odysseus —oh dear boy —\nI couldn’t know you before . . .\nnot till I touched the body of my king!”\nShe glanced at Penelope, keen to signal her\n540  that here was her own dear husband, here and now,\nbut she could not catch the glance, she took no heed,\nAthena turned her attention elsewhere. But Odysseus —\nhis right hand shot out, clutching the nurse’s throat,\nwith his left he hugged her to himself and muttered,\n“Nurse, you want to kill me? You suckled me yourself\nat your own breast —and now I’m home, at last,\nafter bearing twenty years of brutal hardship,\nhome, on native ground. But now you know,\nnow that a god has flashed it in your mind,\n550  quiet! not a word to anyone in the house.\nOr else, I warn you —and I mean business too —\nif a god beats down these brazen suitors at my hands,\nI will not spare you —my old nurse that you are —\nwhen I kill the other women in my house.”\n“Child,” shrewd old Eurycleia protested,\n“what nonsense you let slip through your teeth!\nYou know me —I’m stubborn, never give an inch —\nI’ll keep still as solid rock or iron.\nOne more thing. Take it to heart, I tell you.\n560  If a god beats down these brazen suitors at your hands,\nI’ll report in full on the women in your house:\nwho are disloyal to you, who are guiltless.”\n“Nurse,” the cool tactician Odysseus said,\n“why bother to count them off? A waste of breath.\nI’ll observe them, judge each one myself.\nJust be quiet. Keep your tales to yourself.\nLeave the rest to the gods.”\nthe old nurse went padding along the halls\nto fetch more water —her basin had all spilled —\n570  and once she’d bathed and rubbed him down with oil,\nOdysseus drew his chair up near the fire again,\ntrying to keep warm,\nbut he hid his scar beneath his beggar’s rags\nas cautious Penelope resumed their conversation:\n“My friend, I have only one more question for you,\nsomething slight, now the hour draws on for welcome sleep —\nfor those who can yield to sweet repose, that is,\nheartsick as they are. As for myself, though,\nsome god has sent me pain that knows no bounds.\n580  All day long I indulge myself in sighs and tears\nas I see to my tasks, direct the household women.\nWhen night falls and the world lies lost in sleep,\nI take to my bed, my heart throbbing, about to break,\nanxieties swarming, piercing —I may go mad with grief.\nLike Pandareus’ daughter, the nightingale in the green woods\nlifting her lovely song at the first warm rush of spring,\nperched in the treetops’ rustling leaves and pouring forth\nher music shifting, trilling and sinking, rippling high to burst\nin grief for Itylus, her beloved boy, King Zethus’ son\n590  whom she in innocence once cut down with bronze . . .\nso my wavering heart goes shuttling, back and forth:\nDo I stay beside my son and keep all things secure —\nmy lands, my serving-women, the grand high-roofed house —\ntrue to my husband’s bed, the people’s voice as well?\nOr do I follow, at last, the best man who courts me\nhere in the halls, who gives the greatest gifts?\nMy son —when he was a boy and lighthearted —\nurged me not to marry and leave my husband’s house.\nBut now he has grown and reached his young prime,\n600  he begs me to leave our palace, travel home.\nTelemachus, so obsessed with his own estate,\nthe wealth my princely suitors bleed away.\nBut please,\nread this dream for me, won’t you? Listen closely . . .\nI keep twenty geese in the house, from the water trough\nthey come and peck their wheat —I love to watch them all.\nBut down from a mountain swooped this great hook-beaked eagle,\nyes, and he snapped their necks and killed them one and all\nand they lay in heaps throughout the halls while he,\nback to the clear blue sky he soared at once.\n610  But I wept and wailed —only a dream, of course —\nand our well-groomed ladies came and clustered round me,\nsobbing, stricken: the eagle killed my geese. But down\nhe swooped again and settling onto a jutting rafter\ncalled out in a human voice that dried my tears,\n‘Courage, daughter of famous King Icarius!\nThis is no dream but a happy waking vision,\nreal as day, that will come true for you.\nThe geese were your suitors —I was once the eagle\nbut now I am your husband, back again at last,\n620  about to launch a terrible fate against them all!’\nSo he vowed, and the soothing sleep released me.\nI peered around and saw my geese in the house,\npecking at their wheat, at the same trough\nwhere they always took their meal.”\n“Dear woman,”\nquick Odysseus answered, “twist it however you like,\nyour dream can only mean one thing. Odysseus\ntold you himself —he’ll make it come to pass.\nDestruction is clear for each and every suitor;\nnot a soul escapes his death and doom.”\n630    “Ah my friend,” seasoned Penelope dissented,\n“dreams are hard to unravel, wayward, drifting things —\nnot all we glimpse in them will come to pass . . .\nTwo gates there are for our evanescent dreams,\none is made of ivory, the other made of horn.\nThose that pass through the ivory cleanly carved\nare will-o’-the-wisps, their message bears no fruit.\nThe dreams that pass through the gates of polished horn\nare fraught with truth, for the dreamer who can see them.\nBut I can’t believe my strange dream has come that way,\n640  much as my son and I would love to have it so.\nOne more thing I’ll tell you —weigh it well.\nThe day that dawns today, this cursed day,\nwill cut me off from Odysseus’ house. Now,\nI mean to announce a contest with those axes,\nthe ones he would often line up here inside the hall,\ntwelve in a straight unbroken row like blocks to shore a keel,\nthen stand well back and whip an arrow through the lot.\nNow I will bring them on as a trial for my suitors.\nThe hand that can string the bow with greatest ease,\n650  that shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes —\nhe’s the man I follow, yes, forsaking this house\nwhere I was once a bride, this gracious house\nso filled with the best that life can offer —\nI shall always remember it, that I know . . .\neven in my dreams.”\n“Oh my queen,”\nOdysseus, man of exploits, urged her on,\n“royal wife of Laertes’ son, Odysseus, now,\ndon’t put off this test in the halls a moment.\nBefore that crew can handle the polished bow,\n660  string it taut and shoot through all those axes —\nOdysseus, man of exploits, will be home with you!”\n“If only, my friend,” the wise Penelope replied,\n“you were willing to sit beside me in the house,\nindulging me in the comfort of your presence,\nsleep would never drift across my eyes.\nBut one can’t go without one’s sleep forever.\nThe immortals give each thing its proper place\nin our mortal lives throughout the good green earth.\nSo now I’m going back to my room upstairs\n670  and lie down on my bed,\nthat bed of pain my tears have streaked, year in,\nyear out, from the day Odysseus sailed away to see . . .\nDestroy, I call it —I hate to say its name!\nThere I’ll rest, while you lie here in the hall,\nspreading your blankets somewhere on the floor,\nor the women will prepare a decent bed.”\nthe queen went up to her lofty well-lit room\nand not alone: her women followed close behind.\nPenelope, once they reached the upper story,\n680  fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,\ntill watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep."

    "text": "Off in the entrance-hall the great king made his bed,\nspreading out on the ground the raw hide of an ox,\nheaping over it fleece from sheep the suitors\nbutchered day and night, then Eurynome threw\na blanket over him, once he’d nestled down.\nAnd there Odysseus lay . . .\nplotting within himself the suitors’ death —\nawake, alert, as the women slipped from the house,\nthe maids who whored in the suitors’ beds each night,\n10  tittering, linking arms and frisking as before.\nThe master’s anger rose inside his chest,\ntorn in thought, debating, head and heart —\nshould he up and rush them, kill them one and all\nor let them rut with their lovers one last time?\nThe heart inside him growled low with rage,\nas a bitch mounting over her weak, defenseless puppies\ngrowls, facing a stranger, bristling for a showdown —\nso he growled from his depths, hackles rising at their outrage.\nBut he struck his chest and curbed his fighting heart:\n20  “Bear up, old heart! You’ve borne worse, far worse,\nthat day when the Cyclops, man-mountain, bolted\nyour hardy comrades down. But you held fast —\nNobody but your cunning pulled you through\nthe monster’s cave you thought would be your death.”\nSo he forced his spirit into submission,\nthe rage in his breast reined back —unswerving,\nall endurance. But he himself kept tossing, turning,\nintent as a cook before some white-hot blazing fire\nwho rolls his sizzling sausage back and forth,\n30  packed with fat and blood —keen to broil it quickly,\ntossing, turning it, this way, that way —so he cast about:\nhow could he get these shameless suitors in his clutches,\none man facing a mob? . . . when close to his side she came,\nAthena sweeping down from the sky in a woman’s build\nand hovering at his head, the goddess spoke:\n“Why still awake? The unluckiest man alive!\nHere is your house, your wife at home, your son,\nas fine a boy as one could hope to have.”\nthe wily fighter replied, “how right you are, goddess,\n40  but still this worry haunts me, heart and soul —\nhow can I get these shameless suitors in my clutches?\nSingle-handed, braving an army always camped inside.\nThere’s another worry, that haunts me even more.\nWhat if I kill them —thanks to you and Zeus —\nhow do I run from under their avengers?\nShow me the way, I ask you.”\n“Impossible man!”\nAthena bantered, the goddess’ eyes ablaze.\n“Others are quick to trust a weaker comrade,\nsome poor mortal, far less cunning than I.\n50  But I am a goddess, look, the very one who\nguards you in all your trials to the last.\nI tell you this straight out:\neven if fifty bands of mortal fighters\nclosed around us, hot to kill us off in battle,\nstill you could drive away their herds and sleek flocks!\nSo, surrender to sleep at last. What a misery,\nkeeping watch through the night, wide awake —\nyou’ll soon come up from under all your troubles.”\nWith that she showered sleep across his eyes\n60  and back to Olympus went the lustrous goddess.\nAs soon as sleep came on him, loosing his limbs,\nslipping the toils of anguish from his mind,\nhis devoted wife awoke and,\nsitting up in her soft bed, returned to tears.\nWhen the queen had wept to her heart’s content\nshe prayed to the Huntress, Artemis, first of all:\n“Artemis —goddess, noble daughter of Zeus, if only\nyou’d whip an arrow through my breast and tear my life out,\nnow, at once! Or let some whirlwind pluck me up\n70  and sweep me away along those murky paths and\nfling me down where the Ocean River running\nround the world rolls back upon itself!\nas the whirlwinds swept away Pandareus’ daughters —\nyears ago, when the gods destroyed their parents,\nleaving the young girls orphans in their house.\nBut radiant Aphrodite nursed them well\non cheese and luscious honey and heady wine,\nand Hera gave them beauty and sound good sense,\nmore than all other women —virgin Artemis made them tall\n80  and Athena honed their skills to fashion lovely work.\nBut then, when Aphrodite approached Olympus’ peaks\nto ask for the girls their crowning day as brides\nfrom Zeus who loves the lightning —Zeus who knows all,\nall that’s fated, all not fated, for mortal man —\nthen the storm spirits snatched them away\nand passed them on to the hateful Furies,\nyes, for all their loving care.\nmay the gods who rule Olympus blot me out!\nArtemis with your glossy braids, come shoot me dead —\n90  so I can plunge beneath this loathsome earth\nwith the image of Odysseus vivid in my mind.\nNever let me warm the heart of a weaker man!\nEven grief is bearable, true, when someone weeps\nthrough the days, sobbing, heart convulsed with pain\nyet embraced by sleep all night —sweet oblivion, sleep\ndissolving all, the good and the bad, once it seals our eyes —\nbut even my dreams torment me, sent by wicked spirits.\nAgain —just this night —someone lay beside me . . .\nlike Odysseus to the life, when he embarked\n100  with his men-at-arms. My heart raced with joy.\nNo dream, I thought, the waking truth at last!”\nAt those words\nDawn rose on her golden throne in a sudden gleam of light.\nAnd great Odysseus caught the sound of his wife’s cry\nand began to daydream —deep in his heart it seemed\nshe stood beside him, knew him, now, at last . . .\nGathering up the fleece and blankets where he’d slept,\nhe laid them on a chair in the hall, he took the oxhide out\nand spread it down, lifted his hands and prayed to Zeus:\n“Father Zeus, if you really willed it so —to bring me\n110  home over land and sea-lanes, home to native ground\nafter all the pain you brought me —show me a sign,\na good omen voiced by someone awake indoors,\nanother sign, outside, from Zeus himself!”\nAnd Zeus in all his wisdom heard that prayer.\nHe thundered at once, out of his clear blue heavens\nhigh above the clouds, and Odysseus’ spirit lifted.\nThen from within the halls a woman grinding grain\nlet fly a lucky word. Close at hand she was,\nwhere the good commander set the handmills once\n120  and now twelve women in all performed their tasks,\ngrinding the wheat and barley, marrow of men’s bones.\nThe rest were abed by now —they’d milled their stint —\nthis one alone, the frailest of all, kept working on.\nStopping her mill, she spoke an omen for her master:\n“Zeus, Father! King of gods and men, now there\nwas a crack of thunder out of the starry sky —\nand not a cloud in sight!\nSure it’s a sign you’re showing someone now.\nSo, poor as I am, grant me my prayer as well:\n130  let this day be the last, the last these suitors\nbolt their groaning feasts in King Odysseus’ house!\nThese brutes who break my knees —heart-wrenching labor,\ngrinding their grain —now let them eat their last!”\nA lucky omen, linked with Zeus’s thunder.\nOdysseus’ heart leapt up, the man convinced\nhe’d grind the scoundrels’ lives out in revenge.\nthe other maids were gathering in Odysseus’ royal palace,\nraking up on the hearth the fire still going strong.\nTelemachus climbed from bed and dressed at once,\n140  brisk as a young god —\nover his shoulder he slung his well-honed sword,\nhe fastened rawhide sandals under his smooth feet,\nhe seized his tough spear tipped with a bronze point\nand took his stand at the threshold, calling Eurycleia:\n“Dear nurse, how did you treat the stranger in our house?\nWith bed and board? Or leave him to lie untended?\nThat would be mother’s way —sensible as she is —\nall impulse, doting over some worthless stranger,\nturning a good man out to face the worst.”\n150    “Please, child,” his calm old nurse replied,\n“don’t blame her —your mother’s blameless this time.\nHe sat and drank his wine till he’d had his fill.\nFood? He’d lost his hunger. But she asked him.\nAnd when it was time to think of turning in,\nshe told the maids to spread a decent bed, but he —\nso down-and-out, poor soul, so dogged by fate —\nsaid no to snuggling into a bed, between covers.\nNo sir, the man lay down in the entrance-hall,\non the raw hide of an ox and sheep’s fleece,\nand we threw a blanket over him, so we did.”\n160                                                 Hearing that,\nTelemachus strode out through the palace, spear in hand,\nand a pair of sleek hounds went trotting at his heels.\nHe made for the meeting grounds to join the island lords\nwhile Eurycleia the daughter of Ops, Pisenor’s son,\nthat best of women, gave the maids their orders:\n“Quick now, look alive, sweep out the house,\nwet down the floors!\nYou, those purple coverlets,\nfling them over the fancy chairs!\nAll those tables,\nsponge them down —scour the winebowls, burnished cups!\n170  The rest —now off you go to the spring and fetch some water,\nfast as your legs can run!\nOur young gallants won’t be long from the palace,\nthey’ll be bright and early —today’s a public feast.”\nThey hung on her words and ran to do her bidding.\nFull twenty scurried off to the spring’s dark water,\nothers bent to the housework, all good hands.\nThen in they trooped, the strutting serving-men,\nwho split the firewood cleanly now as the women\nbustled in from the spring, the swineherd at their heels,\n180  driving three fat porkers, the best of all his herds.\nAnd leaving them to root in the broad courtyard,\nup he went to Odysseus, hailed him warmly:\n“Friend, do the suitors show you more respect\nor treat you like the dregs of the earth as always?”\n“Good Eumaeus,” the crafty man replied,\n“if only the gods would pay back their outrage!\nWild and reckless young cubs, conniving here\nin another’s house. They’ve got no sense of shame.”\nAnd now as the two confided in each other,\n190  the goatherd Melanthius sauntered toward them,\nherding his goats with a pair of drovers’ help,\nthe pick of his flocks to make the suitors’ meal.\nUnder the echoing porch he tethered these, then turned\non Odysseus once again with cutting insults: “Still alive?\nStill hounding your betters, begging round the house?\nWhy don’t you cart yourself away? Get out!\nWe’ll never part, I swear,\ntill we taste each other’s fists. Riffraff,\nyou and your begging make us sick! Get out —\n200  we’re hardly the only banquet on the island.”\nNo reply. The wily one just shook his head,\nsilent, his mind churning with thoughts of bloody work . . .\nThird to arrive was Philoetius, that good cowherd,\nprodding in for the crowd a heifer and fat goats.\nBoatmen had brought them over from the mainland,\ncrews who ferry across all travelers too,\nwhoever comes for passage.\nUnder the echoing porch he tethered all heads well\nand then approached the swineherd, full of questions:\n210  “Who’s this stranger, Eumaeus, just come to the house?\nWhat roots does the man claim —who are his people?\nWhere are his blood kin? his father’s fields?\nPoor beggar. But what a build —a royal king’s!\nAh, once the gods weave trouble into our lives\nthey drive us across the earth, they drown us all in pain,\neven kings of the realm.”\nAnd with that thought\nhe walked up to Odysseus, gave him his right hand\nand winged a greeting: “Cheers, old friend, old father,\nhere’s to your luck, great days from this day on —\n220  saddled now as you are with so much trouble.\nFather Zeus, no god’s more deadly than you!\nNo mercy for men, you give them life yourself\nthen plunge them into misery, brutal hardship.\nI broke into sweat, my friend, when I first saw you —\nsee, my eyes still brim with tears, remembering him,\nOdysseus . . . He must wear such rags, I know it,\nknocking about, drifting through the world\nif he’s still alive and sees the light of day.\nIf he’s dead already, lost in the House of Death,\n230  my heart aches for Odysseus, my great lord and master.\nHe set me in charge of his herds, in Cephallenian country,\nwhen I was just a youngster. How they’ve grown by now,\npast counting! No mortal on earth could breed\na finer stock of oxen —broad in the brow,\nthey thrive like ears of corn. But just look,\nthese interlopers tell me to drive them in\nfor their own private feasts. Not a thought\nfor the young prince in the house, they never flinch —\nno regard for the gods’ wrath —in their mad rush\n240  to carve up his goods, my master gone so long!\nI’m tossed from horn to horn in my own mind . . .\nWhat a traitor I’d be, with the prince still alive,\nif I’d run off to some other country, herds and all,\nto a new set of strangers. Ah, but isn’t it worse\nto hold out here, tending the herds for upstarts,\nnot their owners —suffering all the pains of hell?\nI could have fled, ages ago, to some great king\nwho’d give me shelter. It’s unbearable here.\nTrue, but I still dream of my old master,\n250  unlucky man —if only he’d drop in from the blue\nand drive these suitors all in a rout throughout the halls!”\n“Cowherd,” the cool tactician Odysseus answered,\n“you’re no coward, and nobody’s fool, I’d say.\nEven I can see there’s sense in that old head.\nSo I tell you this on my solemn, binding oath:\nI swear by Zeus, the first of all the gods —\nby the table of hospitality waiting for us,\nby Odysseus’ hearth where I have come for help,\nOdysseus will come home while you’re still here.\n260  You’ll see with your own eyes, if you have the heart,\nthese suitors who lord it here cut down in blood.”\n“Stranger, if only,” the cowherd cried aloud,\n“if only Zeus would make that oath come true —\nyou’d see my power, my fighting arms in action!”\nEumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods\nthat their wise king would soon come home again.\nNow as they spoke and urged each other on,\nand once more the suitors were plotting certain doom\nfor the young prince —suddenly, banking high on the left\n270  an omen flew past, an eagle clutching a trembling dove.\nAnd Amphinomus rose in haste to warn them all,\n“My friends, we’ll never carry off this plot\nto kill the prince. Let’s concentrate on feasting.”\nHis timely invitation pleased them all.\nThe suitors ambled into Odysseus’ royal house\nand flinging down their cloaks on a chair or bench,\nthey butchered hulking sheep and fatted goats,\nfull-grown hogs and a young cow from the herd.\nThey roasted all the innards, served them round\n280  and filled the bowls with wine and mixed it well.\nEumaeus passed out cups; Philoetius, trusty herdsman,\nbrought on loaves of bread in ample wicker trays;\nMelanthius poured the wine. The whole company\nreached out for the good things that lay at hand.\nTelemachus, maneuvering shrewdly, sat his father down\non the stone threshold, just inside the timbered hall,\nand set a rickety stool and cramped table there.\nHe gave him a share of innards, poured his wine\nin a golden cup and added a bracing invitation:\n290  “Now sit right there. Drink your wine with the crowd.\nI’ll defend you from all their taunts and blows,\nthese young bucks. This is no public place,\nthis is Odysseus’ house —\nmy father won it for me, so it’s mine.\nYou suitors, control yourselves. No insults now,\nno brawling, no, or it’s war between us all.”\nSo he declared. And they all bit their lips,\namazed the prince could speak with so much daring.\nOnly Eupithes’ son Antinous ventured,\n300  “Fighting words, but do let’s knuckle under —\nto our prince. Such abuse, such naked threats!\nBut clearly Zeus has foiled us. Or long before\nwe would have shut his mouth for him in the halls,\nfluent and flowing as he is.”\nSo he mocked.\nTelemachus paid no heed.\nAnd now through the streets\nthe heralds passed, leading the beasts marked out\nfor sacrifice on Apollo’s grand festal day,\nand the islanders with their long hair were filing\ninto the god’s shady grove —the distant deadly Archer.\n310    Those in the palace, once they’d roasted the prime cuts,\npulled them off the spits and, sharing out the portions,\nfell to the royal feast . . .\nThe men who served them gave Odysseus his share,\nas fair as the helping they received themselves.\nSo Telemachus ordered, the king’s own son.\nBut Athena had no mind to let the brazen suitors\nhold back now from their heart-rending insults —\nshe meant to make the anguish cut still deeper\ninto the core of Laertes’ son Odysseus.\n320  There was one among them, a lawless boor —\nCtesippus was his name, he made his home in Same,\na fellow so impressed with his own astounding wealth\nhe courted the wife of Odysseus, gone for years.\nNow the man harangued his swaggering comrades:\n“Listen to me, my fine friends, here’s what I say!\nFrom the start our guest has had his fair share —\nit’s only right, you know.\nHow impolite it would be, how wrong to scant\nwhatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house.\n330  Look here, I’ll give him a proper guest-gift too,\na prize he can hand the crone who bathes his feet\nor a tip for another slave who haunts the halls\nof our great king Odysseus!”\nOn that note,\ngrabbing an oxhoof out of a basket where it lay,\nwith a brawny hand he flung it straight at the king —\nbut Odysseus ducked his head a little, dodging the blow,\nand seething just as the oxhoof hit the solid wall\nhe clenched his teeth in a wry sardonic grin.\nTelemachus dressed Ctesippus down at once:\n340  “Ctesippus, you can thank your lucky stars\nyou missed our guest —he ducked your blow, by god!\nElse I would have planted my sharp spear in your bowels —\nyour father would have been busy with your funeral,\nnot your wedding here. Enough.\nDon’t let me see more offenses in my house,\nnot from anyone! I’m alive to it all, now,\nthe good and the bad —the boy you knew is gone.\nBut I still must bear with this, this lovely sight . . .\nsheepflocks butchered, wine swilled, food squandered —\n350  how can a man fight off so many single-handed?\nBut no more of your crimes against me, please!\nUnless you’re bent on cutting me down, now,\nand I’d rather die, yes, better that by far\nthan have to look on at your outrage day by day:\nguests treated to blows, men dragging the serving-women\nthrough our noble house, exploiting them all, no shame!”\nDead quiet. The suitors all fell silent, hushed.\nAt last Damastor’s son Agelaus rose and said,\n“Fair enough, my friends; when a man speaks well\n360  we have no grounds for wrangling, no cause for abuse.\nHands off this stranger! Or any other servant\nin King Odysseus’ palace. But now a word\nof friendly advice for Telemachus and his mother —\nhere’s hoping it proves congenial to them both.\nSo long as your hearts still kept a spark alive\nthat Odysseus would return —that great, deep man —\nwho could blame you, playing the waiting game at home\nand holding off the suitors? The better course, it’s true.\nWhat if Odysseus had returned, had made it home at last?\n370  But now it’s clear as day —the man will come no more.\nSo go, Telemachus, sit with your mother, coax her\nto wed the best man here, the one who offers most,\nso you can have and hold your father’s estate,\neating and drinking here, your mind at peace\nwhile mother plays the wife in another’s house.”\nThe young prince, keeping his poise, replied,\n“I swear by Zeus, Agelaus, by all my father suffered —\ndead, no doubt, or wandering far from Ithaca these days —\nI don’t delay my mother’s marriage, not a moment,\n380  I press her to wed the man who takes her heart.\nI’ll shower her myself with boundless gifts.\nBut I shrink from driving mother from our house,\nissuing harsh commands against her will.\nGod forbid it ever comes to that!”\nSo he vowed\nand Athena set off uncontrollable laughter in the suitors,\ncrazed them out of their minds —mad, hysterical laughter\nseemed to break from the jaws of strangers, not their own,\nand the meat they were eating oozed red with blood —\ntears flooded their eyes, hearts possessed by grief.\n390  The inspired seer Theoclymenus wailed out in their midst,\n“Poor men, what terror is this that overwhelms you so?\nNight shrouds your heads, your faces, down to your knees —\ncries of mourning are bursting into fire —cheeks rivering tears —\nthe walls and the handsome crossbeams dripping dank with blood!\nGhosts, look, thronging the entrance, thronging the court,\ngo trooping down to the world of death and darkness!\nThe sun is blotted out of the sky —look there —\na lethal mist spreads all across the earth!”\nthey all broke into peals of laughter aimed at the seer —\n400  Polybus’ son Eurymachus braying first and foremost,\n“Our guest just in from abroad, the man is raving!\nQuick, my boys, hustle him out of the house,\ninto the meeting grounds, the light of day —\neverything here he thinks is dark as night!”\n“Eurymachus,” the inspired prophet countered,\n“when I want your escort, I’ll ask for it myself.\nI have eyes and ears, and both my feet, still,\nand a head that’s fairly sound,\nnothing to be ashamed of. These will do\nto take me past those doors . . .\n410                                  Oh I can see it now —\nthe disaster closing on you all! There’s no escaping it,\nno way out —not for a single one of you suitors,\nwild reckless fools, plotting outrage here,\nthe halls of Odysseus, great and strong as a god!”\nWith that he marched out of the sturdy house\nand went home to Piraeus, the host who warmed him in.\nNow all the suitors, trading their snide glances, started\nheckling Telemachus, made a mockery of his guests.\nOne or another brash young gallant scoffed,\n420  “Telemachus, no one’s more unlucky with his guests!”\n“Look what your man dragged in —this mangy tramp\nscraping for bread and wine!”\n“Not fit for good hard work,\nthe bag of bones —”\n“A useless dead weight on the land!”\n“And then this charlatan up and apes the prophet.”\n“Take it from me —you’ll be better off by far —\ntoss your friends in a slave-ship —”\n“Pack them off\nto Sicily, fast —they’ll fetch you one sweet price!”\nSo they jeered, but the prince paid no attention . . .\nsilent, eyes riveted on his father, always waiting\n430  the moment he’d lay hands on that outrageous mob.\nAnd all the while Icarius’ daughter, wise Penelope,\nhad placed her carved chair within earshot, at the door,\nso she could catch each word they uttered in the hall.\nLaughing rowdily, men prepared their noonday meal,\nsucculent, rich —they’d butchered quite a herd.\nBut as for supper, what could be less enticing\nthan what a goddess and a powerful man\nwould spread before them soon? A groaning feast —\nfor they’d been first to plot their vicious crimes."

    "text": "The time had come. The goddess Athena with her blazing eyes\ninspired Penelope, Icarius’ daughter, wary, poised,\nto set the bow and the gleaming iron axes out\nbefore her suitors waiting in Odysseus’ hall —\nto test their skill and bring their slaughter on.\nUp the steep stairs to her room she climbed\nand grasped in a steady hand the curved key —\nfine bronze, with ivory haft attached —\nand then with her chamber-women made her way\n10  to a hidden storeroom, far in the palace depths,\nand there they lay, the royal master’s treasures:\nbronze, gold and a wealth of hard wrought iron\nand there it lay as well . . . his backsprung bow\nwith its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain.\nGifts from the old days, from a friend he’d met\nin Lacedaemon —Iphitus, Eurytus’ gallant son.\nOnce in Messene the two struck up together,\nin sly Ortilochus’ house, that time Odysseus\nwent to collect a debt the whole realm owed him,\nfor Messenian raiders had lifted flocks from Ithaca,\nthree hundred head in their oarswept ships, the herdsmen too.\nSo his father and island elders sent Odysseus off,\na young boy on a mission,\na distant embassy made to right that wrong.\nIphitus went there hunting the stock that he had lost,\na dozen mares still nursing their hardy suckling mules.\nThe same mares that would prove his certain death\nwhen he reached the son of Zeus, that iron heart,\nHeracles —the past master of monstrous works —\n30  who killed the man, a guest in his own house.\nBrutal. Not a care for the wrathful eyes of god\nor rites of hospitality he had spread before him,\nno, he dined him, then he murdered him, commandeered\nthose hard-hoofed mares for the hero’s own grange.\nStill on the trail of these when he met Odysseus,\nIphitus gave him the bow his father, mighty Eurytus,\nused to wield as a young man, but when he died\nin his lofty house he left it to his son.\nIn turn, Odysseus gave his friend a sharp sword\n40  and a rugged spear to mark the start of friendship,\ntreasured ties that bind. But before they got to know\nthe warmth of each other’s board, the son of Zeus\nhad murdered Iphitus, Eurytus’ magnificent son\nwho gave the prince the bow.\nThat great weapon —\nKing Odysseus never took it abroad with him\nwhen he sailed off to war in his long black ships.\nHe kept it stored away in his stately house,\nguarding the memory of a cherished friend,\nand only took that bow on hunts at home.\n50  the lustrous queen soon reached the hidden vault\nand stopped at the oaken doorsill, work an expert\nsanded smooth and trued to the line some years ago,\nplanting the doorjambs snugly, hanging shining doors.\nAt once she loosed the thong from around its hook,\ninserted the key and aiming straight and true,\nshot back the bolts —and the rasping doors groaned\nas loud as a bull will bellow, champing grass at pasture.\nSo as the key went home those handsome double doors\nrang out now and sprang wide before her.\n60  She stepped onto a plank where chests stood tall,\nbrimming with clothing scented sweet with cedar.\nReaching, tiptoe, lifting the bow down off its peg,\nstill secure in the burnished case that held it,\ndown she sank, laying the case across her knees,\nand dissolved in tears with a high thin wail\nas she drew her husband’s weapon from its sheath . . .\nThen, having wept and sobbed to her heart’s content,\noff she went to the hall to meet her proud admirers,\ncradling her husband’s backsprung bow in her arms,\n70  its quiver bristling arrows, shafts of pain.\nHer women followed, bringing a chest that held\nthe bronze and the iron axes, trophies won by the master.\nThat radiant woman, once she reached her suitors,\ndrawing her glistening veil across her cheeks,\npaused now where a column propped the sturdy roof,\nwith one of her loyal handmaids stationed either side,\nand delivered an ultimatum to her suitors:\n“Listen to me, my overbearing friends!\nYou who plague this palace night and day,\n80  drinking, eating us out of house and home\nwith the lord and master absent, gone so long —\nthe only excuse that you can offer is your zest\nto win me as your bride. So, to arms, my gallants!\nHere is the prize at issue, right before you, look —\nI set before you the great bow of King Odysseus now!\nThe hand that can string this bow with greatest ease,\nthat shoots an arrow clean through all twelve axes —\nhe is the man I follow, yes, forsaking this house\nwhere I was once a bride, this gracious house\n90  so filled with the best that life can offer —\nI shall always remember it, that I know . . .\neven in my dreams.”\nShe turned to Eumaeus,\nordered the good swineherd now to set the bow\nand the gleaming iron axes out before the suitors.\nHe broke into tears as he received them, laid them down.\nThe cowherd wept too, when he saw his master’s bow.\nBut Antinous wheeled on both and let them have it:\n“Yokels, fools —you can’t tell night from day!\nYou mawkish idiots, why are you sniveling here?\n100  You’re stirring up your mistress! Isn’t she drowned\nin grief already? She’s lost her darling husband.\nSit down. Eat in peace, or take your snuffling\nout of doors! But leave that bow right here —\nour crucial test that makes or breaks us all.\nNo easy game, I wager, to string his polished bow.\nNot a soul in the crowd can match Odysseus —\nwhat a man he was . . .\nI saw him once, remember him to this day,\nthough I was young and foolish way back then.”\nSmooth talk,\n110  but deep in the suitor’s heart his hopes were bent\non stringing the bow and shooting through the axes.\nAntinous —fated to be the first man to taste\nan arrow whipped from great Odysseus’ hands,\nthe king he mocked, at ease in the king’s house,\negging comrades on to mock him too.\nPrince Telemachus waded in with a laugh:\n“Zeus up there has robbed me of my wits.\nMy own dear mother, sensible as she is,\nsays she’ll marry again, forsake our house,\n120  and look at me —laughing for all I’m worth,\ngiggling like some fool. Step up, my friends!\nHere is the prize at issue, right before you, look —\na woman who has no equal now in all Achaean country,\nneither in holy Pylos, nor in Argos or Mycenae,\nnot even Ithaca itself or the loamy mainland.\nYou know it well. Why sing my mother’s praises?\nCome, let the games begin! No dodges, no delays,\nno turning back from the stringing of the bow —\nwe’ll see who wins, we will.\n130  I’d even take a crack at the bow myself . . .\nIf I string it and shoot through all the axes,\nI’d worry less if my noble mother left our house\nwith another man and left me here behind —man enough\nat last to win my father’s splendid prizes!”\nhe leapt to his feet and dropped his bright-red cloak,\nslipping the sword and sword-belt off his shoulders.\nFirst he planted the axes, digging a long trench,\none for all, and trued them all to a line\nthen tamped the earth to bed them. Wonder took\n140  the revelers looking on: his work so firm, precise,\nthough he’d never seen the axes ranged before.\nHe stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow . . .\nThree times he made it shudder, straining to bend it,\nthree times his power flagged —but his hopes ran high\nhe’d string his father’s bow and shoot through every iron\nand now, struggling with all his might for the fourth time,\nhe would have strung the bow, but Odysseus shook his head\nand stopped him short despite his tensing zeal.\n“God help me,” the inspired prince cried out,\n150  “must I be a weakling, a failure all my life?\nUnless I’m just too young to trust my hands\nto fight off any man who rises up against me.\nCome, my betters, so much stronger than I am —\ntry the bow and finish off the contest.”\nHe propped his father’s weapon on the ground,\ntilting it up against the polished well-hung doors\nand resting a shaft aslant the bow’s fine horn,\nthen back he went to the seat that he had left.\n“Up, friends!” Antinous called, taking over.\n160  “One man after another, left to right,\nstarting from where the steward pours the wine.”\nSo Antinous urged and all agreed.\nThe first man up was Leodes, Oenops’ son,\na seer who could see their futures in the smoke,\nwho always sat by the glowing winebowl, well back,\nthe one man in the group who loathed their reckless ways,\nappalled by all their outrage. His turn first . . .\nPicking up the weapon now and the swift arrow,\nhe stood at the threshold, poised to try the bow\n170  but failed to bend it. As soon as he tugged the string\nhis hands went slack, his soft, uncallused hands,\nand he called back to the suitors, “Friends,\nI can’t bend it. Take it, someone —try.\nHere is a bow to rob our best of life and breath,\nall our best contenders! Still, better be dead\nthan live on here, never winning the prize\nthat tempts us all —forever in pursuit,\nburning with expectation every day.\nIf there’s still a suitor here who hopes,\n180  who aches to marry Penelope, Odysseus’ wife,\njust let him try the bow; he’ll see the truth!\nHe’ll soon lay siege to another Argive woman\ntrailing her long robes, and shower her with gifts —\nand then our queen can marry the one who offers most,\nthe man marked out by fate to be her husband.”\nWith those words he thrust the bow aside,\ntilting it up against the polished well-hung doors\nand resting a shaft aslant the bow’s fine horn,\nthen back he went to the seat that he had left.\n190  But Antinous turned on the seer, abuses flying:\n“Leodes! what are you saying? what’s got past your lips?\nWhat awful, grisly nonsense —it shocks me to hear it —\n‘here is a bow to rob our best of life and breath!’\nJust because you can’t string it, you’re so weak?\nClearly your genteel mother never bred her boy\nfor the work of bending bows and shooting arrows.\nWe have champions in our ranks to string it quickly.\nHop to it, Melanthius!” —he barked at the goatherd —\n“Rake the fire in the hall, pull up a big stool,\n200  heap it with fleece and fetch that hefty ball\nof lard from the stores inside. So we young lords\ncan heat and limber the bow and rub it down with grease\nbefore we try again and finish off the contest!”\nThe goatherd bustled about to rake the fire\nstill going strong. He pulled up a big stool,\nheaped it with fleece and fetched the hefty ball\nof lard from the stores inside. And the young men\nlimbered the bow, rubbing it down with hot grease,\nthen struggled to bend it back but failed. No use —\n210  they fell far short of the strength the bow required.\nAntinous still held off, dashing Eurymachus too,\nthe ringleaders of all the suitors,\nhead and shoulders the strongest of the lot.\nthe king’s two men, the cowherd and the swineherd,\nhad slipped out of the palace side-by-side\nand great Odysseus left the house to join them.\nOnce they were past the courtyard and the gates\nhe probed them deftly, surely: “Cowherd, swineherd,\nwhat, shall I blurt this out or keep it to myself?\n220  No, speak out. The heart inside me says so.\nHow far would you go to fight beside Odysseus?\nSay he dropped like that from a clear blue sky\nand a god brought him back —\nwould you fight for the suitors or your king?\nTell me how you feel inside your hearts.”\n“Father Zeus,” the trusty cowherd shouted,\n“bring my prayer to pass! Let the master come —\nsome god guide him now! You’d see my power,\nmy fighting arms in action!”\n230    Eumaeus echoed his prayer to all the gods\nthat their wise king would soon come home again.\nCertain at least these two were loyal to the death,\nOdysseus reassured them quickly: “I’m right here,\nhere in the flesh —myself —and home at last,\nafter bearing twenty years of brutal hardship.\nNow I know that of all my men you two alone\nlonged for my return. From the rest I’ve heard\nnot one real prayer that I come back again.\nSo now I’ll tell you what’s in store for you.\n240  If a god beats down the lofty suitors at my hands,\nI’ll find you wives, both of you, grant you property,\nsturdy houses beside my own, and in my eyes you’ll be\ncomrades to Prince Telemachus, brothers from then on.\nCome, I’ll show you something —living proof —\nknow me for certain, put your minds at rest.\nlook, where a boar’s white tusk gored me, years ago,\nhunting on Parnassus, Autolycus’ sons and I.”\npushing back his rags, he revealed the great scar . . .\nAnd the men gazed at it, scanned it, knew it well,\n250  broke into tears and threw their arms around their master —\nlost in affection, kissing his head and shoulders,\nand so Odysseus kissed their heads and hands.\nNow the sun would have set upon their tears\nif Odysseus had not called a halt himself.\n“No more weeping. Coming out of the house\na man might see us, tell the men inside.\nLet’s slip back in —singly, not in a pack.\nI’ll go first. You’re next. Here’s our signal.\nWhen all the rest in there, our lordly friends,\n260  are dead against my having the bow and quiver,\ngood Eumaeus, carry the weapon down the hall\nand put it in my hands. Then tell the serving-women\nto lock the snugly fitted doors to their own rooms.\nIf anyone hears from there the jolting blows\nand groans of men, caught in our huge net,\nnot one of them show her face —\nsit tight, keep to her weaving, not a sound.\nYou, my good Philoetius, here are your orders.\nShoot the bolt of the courtyard’s outer gate,\nlock it, lash it fast.”\n270                          With that command\nthe master entered his well-constructed house\nand back he went to the stool that he had left.\nThe king’s two men, in turn, slipped in as well.\nJust now Eurymachus held the bow in his hands,\nturning it over, tip to tip, before the blazing fire\nto heat the weapon. But he failed to bend it even so\nand the suitor’s high heart groaned to bursting.\n“A black day,” he exclaimed in wounded pride,\n“a blow to myself, a blow to each man here!\n280  It’s less the marriage that mortifies me now —\nthat’s galling too, but lots of women are left,\nsome in seagirt Ithaca, some in other cities.\nWhat breaks my heart is the fact we fall so short\nof great Odysseus’ strength we cannot string his bow.\nA disgrace to ring in the ears of men to come.”\n“Eurymachus,” Eupithes’ son Antinous countered,\n“it will never come to that, as you well know.\nToday is a feast-day up and down the island\nin honor of the Archer God. Who flexes bows today?\n290  Set it aside. Rest easy now. And all the axes,\nlet’s just leave them planted where they are.\nTrust me, no one’s about to crash the gates\nof Laertes’ son and carry off these trophies.\nSteward, pour some drops for the god in every cup,\nwe’ll tip the wine, then put the bow to bed.\nAnd first thing in the morning have Melanthius\nbring the pick of his goats from all his herds\nso we can burn the thighs to Apollo, god of archers —\nthen try the bow and finish off the contest.”\n300    Welcome advice. And again they all agreed.\nHeralds sprinkled water over their hands for rinsing,\nthe young men brimmed the mixing bowls with wine,\nthey tipped first drops for the god in every cup,\nthen poured full rounds for all. And now, once\nthey’d tipped libations out and drunk their fill,\nthe king of craft, Odysseus, said with all his cunning,\n“Listen to me, you lords who court the noble queen.\nI have to say what the heart inside me urges.\nI appeal especially to Eurymachus, and you,\n310  brilliant Antinous, who spoke so shrewdly now.\nGive the bow a rest for today, leave it to the gods —\nat dawn the Archer God will grant a victory\nto the man he favors most.\nFor the moment,\ngive me the polished bow now, won’t you? So,\nto amuse you all, I can try my hand, my strength . . .\nis the old force still alive inside these gnarled limbs?\nOr has a life of roaming, years of rough neglect,\ndestroyed it long ago?”\nModest words\nthat sent them all into hot, indignant rage,\n320  fearing he just might string the polished bow.\nSo Antinous rounded on him, dressed him down:\n“Not a shred of sense in your head, you filthy drifter!\nNot content to feast at your ease with us, the island’s pride?\nNever denied your full share of the banquet, never,\nyou can listen in on our secrets. No one else\ncan eavesdrop on our talk, no tramp, no beggar.\nThe wine has overpowered you, heady wine —\nthe ruin of many another man, whoever\ngulps it down and drinks beyond his limit.\nWine —it drove the Centaur, famous Eurytion,\nmad in the halls of lionhearted Pirithous.\nThere to visit the Lapiths, crazed with wine\nthe headlong Centaur bent to his ugly work\nin the prince’s own house! His hosts sprang up,\nseized with fury, dragged him across the forecourt,\nflung him out of doors, hacking his nose and ears off\nwith their knives, no mercy. The creature reeled away,\nstill blind with drink, his heart like a wild storm,\nloaded with all the frenzy in his mind!\nthe feud between mortal men and Centaurs had its start.\nBut the drunk was first to bring disaster on himself\nby drowning in his cups. You too, I promise you\nno end of trouble if you should string that bow.\nYou’ll meet no kindness in our part of the world —\nwe’ll sail you off in a black ship to Echetus,\nthe mainland king who wrecks all men alive.\nNothing can save you from his royal grip!\nSo drink, but hold your peace,\ndon’t take on the younger, stronger men.”\n350    “Antinous,” watchful Penelope stepped in,\n“how impolite it would be, how wrong, to scant\nwhatever guest Telemachus welcomes to his house.\nYou really think —if the stranger trusts so to his hands\nand strength that he strings Odysseus’ great bow —\nhe’ll take me home and claim me as his bride?\nHe never dreamed of such a thing, I’m sure.\nDon’t let that ruin the feast for any reveler here.\nUnthinkable —nothing, nothing could be worse.”\nPolybus’ son Eurymachus had an answer:\n360  “Wise Penelope, daughter of Icarius, do we really\nexpect the man to wed you? Unthinkable, I know.\nBut we do recoil at the talk of men and women.\nOne of the island’s meaner sort will mutter,\n‘Look at the riffraff courting a king’s wife.\nWeaklings, look, they can’t even string his bow.\nBut along came this beggar, drifting out of the blue —\nstrung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes!’\nGossip will fly. We’ll hang our heads in shame.”\n“Shame?” alert Penelope protested —\n370  “How can you hope for any public fame at all?\nYou who disgrace, devour a great man’s house and home!\nWhy hang your heads in shame over next to nothing?\nOur friend here is a strapping, well-built man\nand claims to be the son of a noble father.\nCome, hand him the bow now, let’s just see . . .\nI tell you this —and I’ll make good my word —\nif he strings the bow and Apollo grants him glory,\nI’ll dress him in shirt and cloak, in handsome clothes,\nI’ll give him a good sharp lance to fight off men and dogs,\n380  give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet\nand send him off, wherever his heart desires.”\npoised Telemachus broke in now, “my father’s bow —\nno Achaean on earth has more right than I\nto give it or withhold it, as I please.\nOf all the lords in Ithaca’s rocky heights\nor the islands facing Elis grazed by horses,\nnot a single one will force or thwart my will,\neven if I decide to give our guest this bow —\na gift outright —to carry off himself.\nSo, mother,\n390  go back to your quarters. Tend to your own tasks,\nthe distaff and the loom, and keep the women\nworking hard as well. As for the bow now,\nmen will see to that, but I most of all:\nI hold the reins of power in this house.”\nAstonished,\nshe withdrew to her own room. She took to heart\nthe clear good sense in what her son had said.\nClimbing up to the lofty chamber with her women,\nshe fell to weeping for Odysseus, her beloved husband,\ntill watchful Athena sealed her eyes with welcome sleep.\n400    And now the loyal swineherd had lifted up the bow,\nwas taking it toward the king, when all the suitors\nburst out in an ugly uproar through the palace —\nbrash young bullies, this or that one heckling,\n“Where on earth are you going with that bow?”\n“You, you grubby swineherd, are you crazy?”\n“The speedy dogs you reared will eat your corpse —”\n“Out there with your pigs, out in the cold, alone!”\n“If only Apollo and all the gods shine down on us!”\nEumaeus froze in his tracks, put down the bow,\n410  panicked by every outcry in the hall.\nTelemachus shouted too, from the other side,\nand full of threats: “Carry on with the bow, old boy!\nIf you serve too many masters, you’ll soon suffer.\nLook sharp, or I’ll pelt you back to your farm\nwith flying rocks. I may be younger than you\nbut I’m much stronger. If only I had that edge\nin fists and brawn over all this courting crowd,\nI’d soon dispatch them —licking their wounds at last —\nclear of our palace where they plot their vicious plots!”\n420    His outburst sent them all into gales of laughter,\nblithe and oblivious, that dissolved their pique\nagainst the prince. The swineherd took the bow,\ncarried it down the hall to his ready, waiting king\nand standing by him, placed it in his hands,\nthen he called the nurse aside and whispered,\n“Good Eurycleia —Telemachus commands you now\nto lock the snugly fitted doors to your own rooms.\nIf anyone hears from there the jolting blows\nand groans of men, caught in our huge net,\n430  not one of you show your face —\nsit tight, keep to your weaving, not a sound.”\nThat silenced the old nurse —\nshe barred the doors that led from the long hall.\nThe cowherd quietly bounded out of the house\nto lock the gates of the high-stockaded court.\nUnder the portico lay a cable, ship’s tough gear:\nhe lashed the gates with this, then slipped back in\nand ran and sat on the stool that he’d just left,\neyes riveted on Odysseus.\nNow he held the bow\n440  in his own hands, turning it over, tip to tip,\ntesting it, this way, that way . . . fearing worms\nhad bored through the weapon’s horn with the master gone abroad.\nA suitor would glance at his neighbor, jeering, taunting,\n“Look at our connoisseur of bows!”\n“Sly old fox —\nmaybe he’s got bows like it, stored in his house.”\n“That or he’s bent on making one himself.”\n“Look how he twists and turns it in his hands!”\n“The clever tramp means trouble —”\n“I wish him luck,” some cocksure lord chimed in,\n450  “as good as his luck in bending back that weapon!”\nSo they mocked, but Odysseus, mastermind in action,\nonce he’d handled the great bow and scanned every inch,\nthen, like an expert singer skilled at lyre and song —\nwho strains a string to a new peg with ease,\nmaking the pliant sheep-gut fast at either end —\nso with his virtuoso ease Odysseus strung his mighty bow.\nQuickly his right hand plucked the string to test its pitch\nand under his touch it sang out clear and sharp as a swallow’s cry.\nHorror swept through the suitors, faces blanching white,\n460  and Zeus cracked the sky with a bolt, his blazing sign,\nand the great man who had borne so much rejoiced at last\nthat the son of cunning Cronus flung that omen down for him.\nHe snatched a winged arrow lying bare on the board —\nthe rest still bristled deep inside the quiver,\nsoon to be tasted by all the feasters there.\nSetting shaft on the handgrip, drawing the notch\nand bowstring back, back . . . right from his stool,\njust as he sat but aiming straight and true, he let fly —\nand never missing an ax from the first ax-handle\n470  clean on through to the last and out\nthe shaft with its weighted brazen head shot free!\n“Telemachus,”\nOdysseus looked to his son and said, “your guest,\nsitting here in your house, has not disgraced you.\nNo missing the mark, look, and no long labor spent\nto string the bow. My strength’s not broken yet,\nnot quite so frail as the mocking suitors thought.\nBut the hour has come to serve our masters right —\nsupper in broad daylight —then to other revels,\nsong and dancing, all that crowns a feast.”\n480    He paused with a warning nod, and at that sign\nPrince Telemachus, son of King Odysseus,\ngirding his sharp sword on, clamping hand to spear,\ntook his stand by a chair that flanked his father —\nhis bronze spearpoint glinting now like fire . . ."

    "text": "Now stripping back his rags Odysseus master of craft and battle\nvaulted onto the great threshold, gripping his bow and quiver\nbristling arrows, and poured his flashing shafts before him,\nloose at his feet, and thundered out to all the suitors:\n“Look —your crucial test is finished, now, at last!\nBut another target’s left that no one’s hit before —\nwe’ll see if I can hit it —Apollo give me glory!”\nWith that he trained a stabbing arrow on Antinous . . .\njust lifting a gorgeous golden loving-cup in his hands,\n10  just tilting the two-handled goblet back to his lips,\nabout to drain the wine —and slaughter the last thing\non the suitor’s mind: who could dream that one foe\nin that crowd of feasters, however great his power,\nwould bring down death on himself, and black doom?\nBut Odysseus aimed and shot Antinous square in the throat\nand the point went stabbing clean through the soft neck and out —\nand off to the side he pitched, the cup dropped from his grasp\nas the shaft sank home, and the man’s life-blood came spurting\nfrom his nostrils —\nthick red jets —\na sudden thrust of his foot —\nhe kicked away the table —\n20                             food showered across the floor,\nthe bread and meats soaked in a swirl of bloody filth.\nThe suitors burst into uproar all throughout the house\nwhen they saw their leader down. They leapt from their seats,\nmilling about, desperate, scanning the stone walls —\nnot a shield in sight, no rugged spear to seize.\nThey wheeled on Odysseus, lashing out in fury:\n“Stranger, shooting at men will cost your life!”\n“Your game is over —you, you’ve shot your last!”\n“You’ll never escape your own headlong death!”\n30    “You killed the best in Ithaca —our fine prince!”\n“Vultures will eat your corpse!”\nGroping, frantic —\neach one persuading himself the guest had killed\nthe man by chance. Poor fools, blind to the fact\nthat all their necks were in the noose, their doom sealed.\nWith a dark look, the wily fighter Odysseus shouted back,\n“You dogs! you never imagined I’d return from Troy —\nso cocksure that you bled my house to death,\nravished my serving-women —wooed my wife\nbehind my back while I was still alive!\n40  No fear of the gods who rule the skies up there,\nno fear that men’s revenge might arrive someday —\nnow all your necks are in the noose —your doom is sealed!”\nTerror gripped them all, blanched their faces white,\neach man glancing wildly —how to escape his instant death?\nOnly Eurymachus had the breath to venture, “If you,\nyou’re truly Odysseus of Ithaca, home at last,\nyou’re right to accuse these men of what they’ve done —\nso much reckless outrage here in your palace,\nso much on your lands. But here he lies,\n50  quite dead, and he incited it all —Antinous —\nlook, the man who drove us all to crime!\nNot that he needed marriage, craved it so;\nhe’d bigger game in mind —though Zeus barred his way —\nhe’d lord it over Ithaca’s handsome country, king himself,\nonce he’d lain in wait for your son and cut him down!\nBut now he’s received the death that he deserved.\nSo spare your own people! Later we’ll recoup\nyour costs with a tax laid down upon the land,\ncovering all we ate and drank inside your halls,\n60  and each of us here will pay full measure too —\ntwenty oxen in value, bronze and gold we’ll give\nuntil we melt your heart. Before we’ve settled,\nwho on earth could blame you for your rage?”\nBut the battle-master kept on glaring, seething.\n“No, Eurymachus! Not if you paid me all your father’s wealth —\nall you possess now, and all that could pour in from the world’s end —\nno, not even then would I stay my hands from slaughter\ntill all you suitors had paid for all your crimes!\nNow life or death —your choice —fight me or flee\n70  if you hope to escape your sudden bloody doom!\nI doubt one man in the lot will save his skin!”\nHis menace shook their knees, their hearts too\nbut Eurymachus spoke again, now to the suitors: “Friends!\nThis man will never restrain his hands, invincible hands —\nnow that he’s seized that polished bow and quiver, look,\nhe’ll shoot from the sill until he’s killed us all!\nSo fight —call up the joy of battle! Swords out!\nTables lifted —block his arrows winging death!\nCharge him, charge in a pack —\n80  try to rout the man from the sill, the doors,\nrace through town and sound an alarm at once —\nour friend would soon see he’s shot his bolt!”\nBrave talk —\nhe drew his two-edged sword, bronze, honed for the kill\nand hurled himself at the king with a raw savage cry\nin the same breath that Odysseus loosed an arrow\nripping his breast beside the nipple so hard\nit lodged in the man’s liver —\nout of his grasp the sword dropped to the ground —\nover his table, head over heels he tumbled, doubled up,\n90  flinging his food and his two-handled cup across the floor —\nhe smashed the ground with his forehead, writhing in pain,\nboth feet flailing out, and his high seat tottered —\nthe mist of death came swirling down his eyes.\nAmphinomus rushed the king in all his glory,\ncharging him face-to-face, a slashing sword drawn —\nif only he could force him clear of the doorway, now,\nbut Telemachus —too quick —stabbed the man from behind,\nplunging his bronze spear between the suitor’s shoulders\nand straight on through his chest the point came jutting out —\n100  down he went with a thud, his forehead slammed the ground.\nTelemachus swerved aside, leaving his long spearshaft\nlodged in Amphinomus —fearing some suitor just might\nlunge in from behind as he tugged the shaft,\nimpale him with a sword or hack him down,\ncrouching over the corpse.\nHe went on the run, reached his father at once\nand halting right beside him, let fly, “Father —\nnow I’ll get you a shield and a pair of spears,\na helmet of solid bronze to fit your temples!\n110  I’ll arm myself on the way back and hand out\narms to the swineherd, arm the cowherd too —\nwe’d better fight equipped!”\n“Run, fetch them,”\nthe wily captain urged, “while I’ve got arrows left\nto defend me —or they’ll force me from the doors\nwhile I fight on alone!”\nTelemachus moved to his father’s orders smartly.\nOff he ran to the room where the famous arms lay stored,\ntook up four shields, eight spears, four bronze helmets\nridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these,\n120  ran back to reach his father’s side in no time.\nThe prince was first to case himself in bronze\nand his servants followed suit —both harnessed up\nand all three flanked Odysseus, mastermind of war,\nand he, as long as he’d arrows left to defend himself,\nkept picking suitors off in the palace, one by one\nand down they went, corpse on corpse in droves.\nThen, when the royal archer’s shafts ran out,\nhe leaned his bow on a post of the massive doors —\nwhere walls of the hallway catch the light —and armed:\n130  across his shoulder he slung a buckler four plies thick,\nover his powerful head he set a well-forged helmet,\nthe horsehair crest atop it tossing, bristling terror,\nand grasped two rugged lances tipped with fiery bronze.\nNow a side-door was fitted into the main wall —\nright at the edge of the great hall’s stone sill —\nand led to a passage always shut by good tight boards.\nBut Odysseus gave the swineherd strict commands\nto stand hard by the side-door, guard it well —\nthe only way the suitors might break out.\n140  Agelaus called to his comrades with a plan:\n“Friends, can’t someone climb through the hatch? —\ntell men outside to sound the alarm, be quick —\nour guest would soon see he’d shot his last!”\nThe goatherd Melanthius answered, “Not a chance,\nmy lord —the door to the courtyard’s much too near,\ndangerous too, the mouth of the passage cramped.\nOne strong man could block us, one and all!\nNo, I’ll fetch you some armor to harness on,\nout of the storeroom —there, nowhere else, I’m sure,\n150  the king and his gallant son have stowed their arms!”\nWith that the goatherd clambered up through smoke-ducts\nhigh on the wall and scurried into Odysseus’ storeroom,\nbundled a dozen shields, as many spears and helmets\nridged with horsehair crests and, loaded with these,\nrushed back down to the suitors, quickly issued arms.\nOdysseus’ knees shook, his heart too, when he saw them\nbuckling on their armor, brandishing long spears —\nhere was a battle looming, well he knew.\nHe turned at once to Telemachus, warnings flying:\n160  “A bad break in the fight, my boy! One of the women’s\ntipped the odds against us —or could it be the goatherd?”\n“My fault, father,” the cool clear prince replied,\n“the blame’s all mine. That snug door to the vault,\nI left it ajar —they’ve kept a better watch than I.\nGo, Eumaeus, shut the door to the storeroom,\ncheck and see if it’s one of the women’s tricks\nor Dolius’ son Melanthius. He’s our man, I’d say.”\nAnd even as they conspired, back the goatherd\nclimbed to the room to fetch more burnished arms,\n170  but Eumaeus spotted him, quickly told his king\nwho stood close by: “Odysseus, wily captain,\nthere he goes again, the infernal nuisance —\njust as we suspected —back to the storeroom.\nGive me a clear command!\nDo I kill the man —if I can take him down —\nor drag him back to you, here, to pay in full\nfor the vicious work he’s plotted in your house?”\nOdysseus, master of tactics, answered briskly,\n“I and the prince will keep these brazen suitors\n180  crammed in the hall, for all their battle-fury.\nYou two wrench Melanthius’ arms and legs behind him,\nfling him down in the storeroom —lash his back to a plank\nand strap a twisted cable fast to the scoundrel’s body,\nhoist him up a column until he hits the rafters —\nlet him dangle in agony, still alive,\nfor a good long time!”\nThey hung on his orders, keen to do his will.\nOff they ran to the storeroom, unseen by him inside —\nMelanthius, rummaging after arms, deep in a dark recess\n190  as the two men took their stand, either side of the doorposts,\npoised till the goatherd tried to cross the doorsill . . .\none hand clutching a crested helmet, the other\nan ample old buckler blotched with mildew,\nthe shield Laertes bore as a young soldier once\nbut there it lay for ages, seams on the handstraps split —\nQuick, they rushed him, seized him, haled him back by the hair,\nflung him down on the floor, writhing with terror, bound him\nhand and foot with a chafing cord, wrenched his limbs\nback, back till the joints locked tight —\n200  just as Laertes’ cunning son commanded —\nthey strapped a twisted cable round his body,\nhoisted him up a column until he hit the rafters,\nthen you mocked him, Eumaeus, my good swineherd:\n“Now stand guard through the whole night, Melanthius —\nstretched out on a soft bed fit for you, your highness!\nYou’re bound to see the Morning rising up from the Ocean,\nmounting her golden throne —at just the hour you always\ndrive in goats to feast the suitors in the hall!”\nSo they left him, trussed in his agonizing sling;\n210  they clapped on armor again, shut the gleaming doors\nand ran to rejoin Odysseus, mastermind of war.\nAnd now as the ranks squared off, breathing fury —\nfour at the sill confronting a larger, stronger force\narrayed inside the hall —now Zeus’s daughter Athena,\ntaking the build and voice of Mentor, swept in\nand Odysseus, thrilled to see her, cried out,\n“Rescue us, Mentor, now it’s life or death!\nRemember your old comrade —all the service\nI offered you! We were boys together!”\nSo he cried\n220  yet knew in his bones it was Athena, Driver of Armies.\nBut across the hall the suitors brayed against her,\nAgelaus first, his outburst full of threats:\n“Mentor, never let Odysseus trick you into\nsiding with him to fight against the suitors.\nHere’s our plan of action, and we will see it through!\nOnce we’ve killed them both, the father and the son,\nwe’ll kill you too, for all you’re bent on doing\nhere in the halls —you’ll pay with your own head!\nAnd once our swords have stopped your violence cold —\n230  all your property, all in your house, your fields,\nwe’ll lump it all with Odysseus’ rich estate\nand never let your sons live on in your halls\nor free your wife and daughters to walk through town!”\nNaked threats —and Athena hit new heights of rage,\nshe lashed out at Odysseus now with blazing accusations:\n“Where’s it gone, Odysseus —your power, your fighting heart?\nThe great soldier who fought for famous white-armed Helen,\nbattling Trojans nine long years —nonstop, no mercy,\nmowing their armies down in grueling battle —\n240  you who seized the broad streets of Troy\nwith your fine strategic stroke! How can you —\nnow you’ve returned to your own house, your own wealth —\nbewail the loss of your combat strength in a war with suitors?\nCome, old friend, stand by me! You’ll see action now,\nsee how Mentor the son of Alcimus, that brave fighter,\nkills your enemies, pays you back for service!”\nRousing words —\nbut she gave no all-out turning of the tide, not yet,\nshe kept on testing Odysseus and his gallant son,\nputting their force and fighting heart to proof.\n250  For all the world like a swallow in their sight\nshe flew on high to perch\non the great hall’s central roofbeam black with smoke.\nBut the suitors closed ranks, commanded now by Damastor’s son\nAgelaus, flanked by Eurynomus, Demoptolemus and Amphimedon,\nPisander, Polyctor’s son, and Polybus ready, waiting —\nhead and shoulders the best and bravest of the lot\nstill left to fight for their lives,\nnow that the pelting shafts had killed the rest.\nAgelaus spurred his comrades on with battle-plans:\n260  “Friends, at last the man’s invincible hands are useless!\nMentor has mouthed some empty boasts and flitted off —\njust four are left to fight at the front doors. So now,\nno wasting your long spears —all at a single hurl,\njust six of us launch out in the first wave!\nIf Zeus is willing, we may hit Odysseus,\ncarry off the glory! The rest are nothing\nonce the captain’s down!”\nAt his command,\nconcentrating their shots, all six hurled as one\nbut Athena sent the whole salvo wide of the mark —\n270  one of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors,\nanother the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point\nof a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall.\nSeeing his men untouched by the suitors’ flurry,\nsteady Odysseus leapt to take command:\n“Friends! now it’s for us to hurl at them, I say,\ninto this ruck of suitors! Topping all their crimes\nthey’re mad to strip the armor off our bodies!”\nTaking aim at the ranks, all four let fly as one\nand the lances struck home —Odysseus killed Demoptolemus,\nTelemachus killed Euryades —the swineherd, Elatus —\nand the cowherd cut Pisander down in blood.\nThey bit the dust of the broad floor, all as one.\nBack to the great hall’s far recess the others shrank\nas the four rushed in and plucked up spears from corpses.\nAnd again the suitors hurled their whetted shafts\nbut Athena sent the better part of the salvo wide —\none of them hit the jamb of the great hall’s doors,\nanother the massive door itself, and the heavy bronze point\nof a third ashen javelin crashed against the wall.\n290  True, Amphimedon nicked Telemachus on the wrist —\nthe glancing blade just barely broke his skin.\nCtesippus sent a long spear sailing over\nEumaeus’ buckler, grazing his shoulder blade\nbut the weapon skittered off and hit the ground.\nAnd again those led by the brilliant battle-master\nhurled their razor spears at the suitors’ ranks —\nand now Odysseus raider of cities hit Eurydamas,\nTelemachus hit Amphimedon —Eumaeus, Polybus —\nand the cowherd stabbed Ctesippus\n300  right in the man’s chest and triumphed over his body:\n“Love your mockery, do you? Son of that blowhard Polytherses!\nNo more shooting off your mouth, you idiot, such big talk —\nleave the last word to the gods —they’re much stronger!\nTake this spear, this guest-gift, for the cow’s hoof\nyou once gave King Odysseus begging in his house!”\nSo the master of longhorn cattle had his say —\nas Odysseus, fighting at close quarters, ran Agelaus\nthrough with a long lance —Telemachus speared Leocritus\nso deep in the groin the bronze came punching out his back\n310  and the man crashed headfirst, slamming the ground full-face.\nAnd now Athena, looming out of the rafters high above them,\nbrandished her man-destroying shield of thunder, terrifying\nthe suitors out of their minds, and down the hall they panicked —\nwild, like herds stampeding, driven mad as the darting gadfly\nstrikes in the late spring when the long days come round.\nThe attackers struck like eagles, crook-clawed, hook-beaked,\nswooping down from a mountain ridge to harry smaller birds\nthat skim across the flatland, cringing under the clouds\nbut the eagles plunge in fury, rip their lives out —hopeless,\n320  never a chance of flight or rescue —and people love the sport —\nso the attackers routed suitors headlong down the hall,\nwheeling into the slaughter, slashing left and right\nand grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open —\nthe whole floor awash with blood.\nLeodes now —\nhe flung himself at Odysseus, clutched his knees,\ncrying out to the king with a sudden, winging prayer:\n“I hug your knees, Odysseus —mercy! spare my life!\nNever, I swear, did I harass any woman in your house —\nnever a word, a gesture —nothing, no, I tried\n330  to restrain the suitors, whoever did such things.\nThey wouldn’t listen, keep their hands to themselves —\nso reckless, so they earn their shameful fate.\nBut I was just their prophet —\nmy hands are clean —and I’m to die their death!\nLook at the thanks I get for years of service!”\nA killing look, and the wry soldier answered,\n“Only a priest, a prophet for this mob, you say?\nHow hard you must have prayed in my own house\nthat the heady day of my return would never dawn —\n340  my dear wife would be yours, would bear your children!\nFor that there’s no escape from grueling death —you die!”\nAnd snatching up in one powerful hand a sword\nleft on the ground —Agelaus dropped it when he fell —\nOdysseus hacked the prophet square across the neck\nand the praying head went tumbling in the dust.\nNow one was left,\ntrying still to escape black death. Phemius, Terpis’ son,\nthe bard who always performed among the suitors —\nthey forced the man to sing . . .\nThere he stood, backing into the side-door,\n350  still clutching his ringing lyre in his hands,\nhis mind in turmoil, torn —what should he do?\nSteal from the hall and crouch at the altar-stone\nof Zeus who Guards the Court, where time and again\nOdysseus and Laertes burned the long thighs of oxen?\nOr throw himself on the master’s mercy, clasp his knees?\nThat was the better way —or so it struck him, yes,\ngrasp the knees of Laertes’ royal son. And so,\ncradling his hollow lyre, he laid it on the ground\nbetween the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded throne,\n360  then rushed up to Odysseus, yes, and clutched his knees,\nsinging out to his king with a stirring, winged prayer:\n“I hug your knees, Odysseus —mercy! spare my life!\nWhat a grief it will be to you for all the years to come\nif you kill the singer now, who sings for gods and men.\nI taught myself the craft, but a god has planted\ndeep in my spirit all the paths of song —\nsongs I’m fit to sing for you as for a god.\nCalm your bloodlust now —don’t take my head!\nHe’d bear me out, your own dear son Telemachus —\n370  never of my own will, never for any gain did I\nperform in your house, singing after the suitors\nhad their feasts. They were too strong, too many —\nthey forced me to come and sing —I had no choice!”\nThe inspired Prince Telemachus heard his pleas\nand quickly said to his father close beside him,\n“Stop, don’t cut him down! This one’s innocent.\nSo is the herald Medon —the one who always\ntended me in the house when I was little —\nspare him too. Unless he’s dead by now,\n380  killed by Philoetius or Eumaeus here —\nor ran into you rampaging through the halls.”\nThe herald pricked up his anxious ears at that . . .\ncautious soul, he cowered, trembling, under a chair —\nwrapped in an oxhide freshly stripped —to dodge black death.\nHe jumped in a flash from there, threw off the smelly hide\nand scuttling up to Telemachus, clutching his knees,\nthe herald begged for life in words that fluttered:\n“Here I am, dear boy —spare me! Tell your father,\nflushed with victory, not to kill me with his sword —\n390  enraged as he is with these young lords who bled\nhis palace white and showed you no respect,\nthe reckless fools!”\nBreaking into a smile\nthe canny Odysseus reassured him, “Courage!\nThe prince has pulled you through, he’s saved you now\nso you can take it to heart and tell the next man too:\nclearly doing good puts doing bad to shame.\nNow leave the palace, go and sit outside —\nout in the courtyard, clear of the slaughter —\nyou and the bard with all his many songs.\n400  Wait till I’ve done some household chores\nthat call for my attention.”\nThe two men scurried out of the house at once\nand crouched at the altar-stone of mighty Zeus —\nglancing left and right,\nfearing death would strike at any moment.\nOdysseus scanned his house to see if any man\nstill skulked alive, still hoped to avoid black death.\nBut he found them one and all in blood and dust . . .\ngreat hauls of them down and out like fish that fishermen\n410  drag from the churning gray surf in looped and coiling nets\nand fling ashore on a sweeping hook of beach —some noble catch\nheaped on the sand, twitching, lusting for fresh salt sea\nbut the Sungod hammers down and burns their lives out . . .\nso the suitors lay in heaps, corpse covering corpse.\nAt last the seasoned fighter turned to his son:\n“Telemachus, go, call the old nurse here —\nI must tell her all that’s on my mind.”\nTelemachus ran to do his father’s bidding,\nshook the women’s doors, calling Eurycleia:\n420  “Come out now! Up with you, good old woman!\nYou who watch over all the household hands —\nquick, my father wants you, needs to have a word!”\nCrisp command that left the old nurse hushed —\nshe spread the doors to the well-constructed hall,\nslipped out in haste, and the prince led her on . . .\nShe found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses,\nsplattered with bloody filth like a lion that’s devoured\nsome ox of the field and lopes home, covered with blood,\nhis chest streaked, both jaws glistening, dripping red —\n430  a sight to strike terror. So Odysseus looked now,\nsplattered with gore, his thighs, his fighting hands,\nand she, when she saw the corpses, all the pooling blood,\nwas about to lift a cry of triumph —here was a great exploit,\nlook —but the soldier held her back and checked her zeal\nwith warnings winging home: “Rejoice in your heart,\nold woman —peace! No cries of triumph now.\nIt’s unholy to glory over the bodies of the dead.\nThese men the doom of the gods has brought low,\nand their own indecent acts. They’d no regard\n440  for any man on earth —good or bad —\nwho chanced to come their way. And so, thanks\nto their reckless work, they met this shameful fate.\nQuick, report in full on the women in my halls —\nwho are disloyal to me, who are guiltless?”\n“Surely, child,”\nhis fond old nurse replied, “now here’s the truth.\nFifty women you have inside your house,\nwomen we’ve trained to do their duties well,\nto card the wool and bear the yoke of service.\nSome dozen in all went tramping to their shame,\n450  thumbing their noses at me, at the queen herself!\nAnd Telemachus, just now come of age —his mother\nwould never let the boy take charge of the maids.\nBut let me climb to her well-lit room upstairs\nand tell your wife the news —\nsome god has put the woman fast asleep.”\n“Don’t wake her yet,” the crafty man returned,\n“you tell those women to hurry here at once —\njust the ones who’ve shamed us all along.”\nAway the old nurse bustled through the house\n460  to give the women orders, rush them to the king.\nOdysseus called Telemachus over, both herdsmen too,\nwith strict commands: “Start clearing away the bodies.\nMake the women pitch in too. Chairs and tables —\nscrub them down with sponges, rinse them clean.\nAnd once you’ve put the entire house in order,\nmarch the women out of the great hall —between\nthe roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade —\nand hack them with your swords, slash out all their lives —\nblot out of their minds the joys of love they relished\n470  under the suitors’ bodies, rutting on the sly!”\nThe women crowded in, huddling all together . . .\nwailing convulsively, streaming live warm tears.\nFirst they carried out the bodies of the dead\nand propped them under the courtyard colonnade,\nstanding them one against another. Odysseus\nshouted commands himself, moving things along\nand they kept bearing out the bodies —they were forced.\nNext they scrubbed down the elegant chairs and tables,\nwashed them with sopping sponges, rinsed them clean.\n480  Then Telemachus and the herdsmen scraped smooth\nthe packed earth floor of the royal house with spades\nas the women gathered up the filth and piled it outside.\nAnd then, at last, once the entire house was put in order,\nthey marched the women out of the great hall —between\nthe roundhouse and the courtyard’s strong stockade —\ncrammed them into a dead end, no way out from there,\nand stern Telemachus gave the men their orders:\n“No clean death for the likes of them, by god!\nNot from me —they showered abuse on my head,\nmy mother’s too!\n490                   You sluts —the suitors’ whores!”\nWith that, taking a cable used on a dark-prowed ship\nhe coiled it over the roundhouse, lashed it fast to a tall column,\nhoisting it up so high no toes could touch the ground.\nThen, as doves or thrushes beating their spread wings\nagainst some snare rigged up in thickets —flying in\nfor a cozy nest but a grisly bed receives them —\nso the women’s heads were trapped in a line,\nnooses yanking their necks up, one by one\nso all might die a pitiful, ghastly death . . .\nthey kicked up heels for a little —not for long.\n500                                               Melanthius?\nThey hauled him out through the doorway, into the court,\nlopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife,\ntore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw\nand in manic fury hacked off hands and feet.\nonce they’d washed their own hands and feet,\nthey went inside again to join Odysseus.\nTheir work was done with now.\nBut the king turned to devoted Eurycleia, saying,\n“Bring sulfur, nurse, to scour all this pollution —\n510  bring me fire too, so I can fumigate the house.\nAnd call Penelope here with all her women —\ntell all the maids to come back in at once.”\n“Well said, my boy,” his old nurse replied,\n“right to the point. But wait,\nlet me fetch you a shirt and cloak to wrap you.\nNo more dawdling round the palace, nothing but rags\nto cover those broad shoulders —it’s a scandal!”\n“Fire first,” the good soldier answered.\n“Light me a fire to purify this house.”\n520    The devoted nurse snapped to his command,\nbrought her master fire and brimstone. Odysseus\npurged his palace, halls and court, with cleansing fumes.\nThen back through the royal house the old nurse went\nto tell the women the news and bring them in at once.\nThey came crowding out of their quarters, torch in hand,\nflung their arms around Odysseus, hugged him, home at last,\nand kissed his head and shoulders, seized his hands, and he,\novercome by a lovely longing, broke down and wept . . .\ndeep in his heart he knew them one and all."

    "text": "Up to the rooms the old nurse clambered, chuckling all the way,\nto tell the queen her husband was here now, home at last.\nHer knees bustling, feet shuffling over each other,\ntill hovering at her mistress’ head she spoke:\n“Penelope —child —wake up and see for yourself,\nwith your own eyes, all you dreamed of, all your days!\nHe’s here —Odysseus —he’s come home, at long last!\nHe’s killed the suitors, swaggering young brutes\nwho plagued his house, wolfed his cattle down,\n10  rode roughshod over his son!”\n“Dear old nurse,” wary Penelope replied,\n“the gods have made you mad. They have that power,\nputting lunacy into the clearest head around\nor setting a half-wit on the path to sense.\nThey’ve unhinged you, and you were once so sane.\nWhy do you mock me? —haven’t I wept enough? —\ntelling such wild stories, interrupting my sleep,\nsweet sleep that held me, sealed my eyes just now.\nNot once have I slept so soundly since the day\n20  Odysseus sailed away to see that cursed city . . .\nDestroy, I call it —I hate to say its name!\nNow down you go. Back to your own quarters.\nIf any other woman of mine had come to me,\nrousing me out of sleep with such a tale,\nI’d have her bundled back to her room in pain.\nIt’s only your old gray head that spares you that!”\n“Never” —the fond old nurse kept pressing on —\n“dear child, I’d never mock you! No, it’s all true,\nhe’s here —Odysseus —he’s come home, just as I tell you!\n30  He’s the stranger they all manhandled in the hall.\nTelemachus knew he was here, for days and days,\nbut he knew enough to hide his father’s plans\nso he could pay those vipers back in kind!”\nPenelope’s heart burst in joy, she leapt from bed,\nher eyes streaming tears, she hugged the old nurse\nand cried out with an eager, winging word,\n“Please, dear one, give me the whole story.\nIf he’s really home again, just as you tell me,\nhow did he get those shameless suitors in his clutches? —\n40  single-handed, braving an army always camped inside.”\n“I have no idea,” the devoted nurse replied.\n“I didn’t see it, I didn’t ask —all I heard\nwas the choking groans of men cut down in blood.\nWe crouched in terror —a dark nook of our quarters —\nall of us locked tight behind those snug doors\ntill your boy Telemachus came and called me out —\nhis father rushed him there to do just that. And then\nI found Odysseus in the thick of slaughtered corpses;\nthere he stood and all around him, over the beaten floor,\n50  the bodies sprawled in heaps, lying one on another . . .\nHow it would have thrilled your heart to see him —\nsplattered with bloody filth, a lion with his kill!\nAnd now they’re all stacked at the courtyard gates —\nhe’s lit a roaring fire,\nhe’s purifying the house with cleansing fumes\nand he’s sent me here to bring you back to him.\nFollow me down! So now, after all the years of grief,\nyou two can embark, loving hearts, along the road to joy.\nLook, your dreams, put off so long, come true at last —\n60  he’s back alive, home at his hearth, and found you,\nfound his son still here. And all those suitors\nwho did him wrong, he’s paid them back, he has,\nright in his own house!”\n“Hush, dear woman,”\nguarded Penelope cautioned her at once.\n“Don’t laugh, don’t cry in triumph —not yet.\nYou know how welcome the sight of him would be\nto all in the house, and to me most of all\nand the son we bore together.\nBut the story can’t be true, not as you tell it,\n70  no, it must be a god who’s killed our brazen friends —\nup in arms at their outrage, heartbreaking crimes.\nThey’d no regard for any man on earth —\ngood or bad —who chanced to come their way. So,\nthanks to their reckless work they die their deaths.\nOdysseus? Far from Achaea now, he’s lost all hope\nof coming home . . . he’s lost and gone himself.”\n“Child,” the devoted old nurse protested,\n“what nonsense you let slip through your teeth.\nHere’s your husband, warming his hands at his own hearth,\n80  here —and you, you say he’ll never come home again,\nalways the soul of trust! All right, this too —\nI’ll give you a sign, a proof that’s plain as day.\nThat scar, made years ago by a boar’s white tusk —\nI spotted the scar myself, when I washed his feet,\nand I tried to tell you, ah, but he, the crafty rascal,\nclamped his hand on my mouth —I couldn’t say a word.\nFollow me down now. I’ll stake my life on it:\nif I am lying to you —\nkill me with a thousand knives of pain!”\n90    “Dear old nurse,” composed Penelope responded,\n“deep as you are, my friend, you’ll find it hard\nto plumb the plans of the everlasting gods.\nAll the same, let’s go and join my son\nso I can see the suitors lying dead\nand see . . . the one who killed them.”\nWith that thought\nPenelope started down from her lofty room, her heart\nin turmoil, torn . . . should she keep her distance,\nprobe her husband? Or rush up to the man at once\nand kiss his head and cling to both his hands?\n100  As soon as she stepped across the stone threshold,\nslipping in, she took a seat at the closest wall\nand radiant in the firelight, faced Odysseus now.\nThere he sat, leaning against the great central column,\neyes fixed on the ground, waiting, poised for whatever words\nhis hardy wife might say when she caught sight of him.\nA long while she sat in silence . . . numbing wonder\nfilled her heart as her eyes explored his face.\nOne moment he seemed . . . Odysseus, to the life —\nthe next, no, he was not the man she knew,\n110  a huddled mass of rags was all she saw.\n“Oh mother,” Telemachus reproached her,\n“cruel mother, you with your hard heart!\nWhy do you spurn my father so —why don’t you\nsit beside him, engage him, ask him questions?\nWhat other wife could have a spirit so unbending?\nHolding back from her husband, home at last for her\nafter bearing twenty years of brutal struggle —\nyour heart was always harder than a rock!”\n“My child,”\nPenelope, well-aware, explained, “I’m stunned with wonder,\n120  powerless. Cannot speak to him, ask him questions,\nlook him in the eyes . . . But if he is truly\nOdysseus, home at last, make no mistake:\nwe two will know each other, even better —\nwe two have secret signs,\nknown to us both but hidden from the world.”\nOdysseus, long-enduring, broke into a smile\nand turned to his son with pointed, winging words:\n“Leave your mother here in the hall to test me\nas she will. She soon will know me better.\n130  Now because I am filthy, wear such grimy rags,\nshe spurns me —your mother still can’t bring herself\nto believe I am her husband.\nBut you and I,\nput heads together. What’s our best defense?\nWhen someone kills a lone man in the realm\nwho leaves behind him no great band of avengers,\nstill the killer flees, goodbye to kin and country.\nBut we brought down the best of the island’s princes,\nthe pillars of Ithaca. Weigh it well, I urge you.”\n“Look to it all yourself now, father,” his son\n140  deferred at once. “You are the best on earth,\nthey say, when it comes to mapping tactics.\nNo one, no mortal man, can touch you there.\nBut we’re behind you, hearts intent on battle,\nnor do I think you’ll find us short on courage,\nlong as our strength will last.”\n“Then here’s our plan,”\nthe master of tactics said. “I think it’s best.\nFirst go and wash, and pull fresh tunics on\nand tell the maids in the hall to dress well too.\nAnd let the inspired bard take up his ringing lyre\n150  and lead off for us all a dance so full of heart\nthat whoever hears the strains outside the gates —\na passerby on the road, a neighbor round about —\nwill think it’s a wedding-feast that’s under way.\nNo news of the suitors’ death must spread through town\ntill we have slipped away to our own estates,\nour orchard green with trees. There we’ll see\nwhat winning strategy Zeus will hand us then.”\nThey hung on his words and moved to orders smartly.\nFirst they washed and pulled fresh tunics on,\n160  the women arrayed themselves —the inspired bard\nstruck up his resounding lyre and stirred in all\na desire for dance and song, the lovely lilting beat,\ntill the great house echoed round to the measured tread\nof dancing men in motion, women sashed and lithe.\nAnd whoever heard the strains outside would say,\n“A miracle —someone’s married the queen at last!”\n“One of her hundred suitors.”\n“That callous woman,\ntoo faithless to keep her lord and master’s house\nto the bitter end —”\n“Till he came sailing home.”\n170    So they’d say, blind to what had happened:\nthe great-hearted Odysseus was home again at last.\nThe maid Eurynome bathed him, rubbed him down with oil\nand drew around him a royal cape and choice tunic too.\nAnd Athena crowned the man with beauty, head to foot,\nmade him taller to all eyes, his build more massive,\nyes, and down from his brow the great goddess\nran his curls like thick hyacinth clusters\nfull of blooms. As a master craftsman washes\ngold over beaten silver —a man the god of fire\n180  and Queen Athena trained in every fine technique —\nand finishes off his latest effort, handsome work . . .\nso she lavished splendor over his head and shoulders now.\nHe stepped from his bath, glistening like a god,\nand back he went to the seat that he had left\nand facing his wife, declared,\n“Strange woman! So hard —the gods of Olympus\nmade you harder than any other woman in the world!\nWhat other wife could have a spirit so unbending?\nHolding back from her husband, home at last for her\n190  after bearing twenty years of brutal struggle.\nCome, nurse, make me a bed, I’ll sleep alone.\nShe has a heart of iron in her breast.”\n“Strange man,”\nwary Penelope said. “I’m not so proud, so scornful,\nnor am I overwhelmed by your quick change . . .\nYou look —how well I know —the way he looked,\nsetting sail from Ithaca years ago\naboard the long-oared ship.\nCome, Eurycleia,\nmove the sturdy bedstead out of our bridal chamber —\nthat room the master built with his own hands.\n200  Take it out now, sturdy bed that it is,\nand spread it deep with fleece,\nblankets and lustrous throws to keep him warm.”\nPutting her husband to the proof —but Odysseus\nblazed up in fury, lashing out at his loyal wife:\n“Woman —your words, they cut me to the core!\nWho could move my bed? Impossible task,\neven for some skilled craftsman —unless a god\ncame down in person, quick to lend a hand,\nlifted it out with ease and moved it elsewhere.\n210  Not a man on earth, not even at peak strength,\nwould find it easy to prise it up and shift it, no,\na great sign, a hallmark lies in its construction.\nI know, I built it myself —no one else . . .\nThere was a branching olive-tree inside our court,\ngrown to its full prime, the bole like a column, thickset.\nAround it I built my bedroom, finished off the walls\nwith good tight stonework, roofed it over soundly\nand added doors, hung well and snugly wedged.\nThen I lopped the leafy crown of the olive,\n220  clean-cutting the stump bare from roots up,\nplaning it round with a bronze smoothing-adze —\nI had the skill —I shaped it plumb to the line to make\nmy bedpost, bored the holes it needed with an auger.\nWorking from there I built my bed, start to finish,\nI gave it ivory inlays, gold and silver fittings,\nwove the straps across it, oxhide gleaming red.\nThere’s our secret sign, I tell you, our life story!\nDoes the bed, my lady, still stand planted firm? —\nI don’t know —or has someone chopped away\nthat olive-trunk and hauled our bedstead off?”\n230                                                   Living proof —\nPenelope felt her knees go slack, her heart surrender,\nrecognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.\nShe dissolved in tears, rushed to Odysseus, flung her arms\naround his neck and kissed his head and cried out,\n“Odysseus —don’t flare up at me now, not you,\nalways the most understanding man alive!\nThe gods, it was the gods who sent us sorrow —\nthey grudged us both a life in each other’s arms\nfrom the heady zest of youth to the stoop of old age.\n240  But don’t fault me, angry with me now because I failed,\nat the first glimpse, to greet you, hold you, so . . .\nIn my heart of hearts I always cringed with fear\nsome fraud might come, beguile me with his talk;\nthe world is full of the sort,\ncunning ones who plot their own dark ends.\nRemember Helen of Argos, Zeus’s daughter —\nwould she have sported so in a stranger’s bed\nif she had dreamed that Achaea’s sons were doomed\nto fight and die to bring her home again?\n250  Some god spurred her to do her shameless work.\nNot till then did her mind conceive that madness,\nblinding madness that caused her anguish, ours as well.\nBut now, since you have revealed such overwhelming proof —\nthe secret sign of our bed, which no one’s ever seen\nbut you and I and a single handmaid, Actoris,\nthe servant my father gave me when I came,\nwho kept the doors of our room you built so well . . .\nyou’ve conquered my heart, my hard heart, at last!”\nThe more she spoke, the more a deep desire for tears\n260  welled up inside his breast —he wept as he held the wife\nhe loved, the soul of loyalty, in his arms at last.\nJoy, warm as the joy that shipwrecked sailors feel\nwhen they catch sight of land —Poseidon has struck\ntheir well-rigged ship on the open sea with gale winds\nand crushing walls of waves, and only a few escape, swimming,\nstruggling out of the frothing surf to reach the shore,\ntheir bodies crusted with salt but buoyed up with joy\nas they plant their feet on solid ground again,\nspared a deadly fate. So joyous now to her\n270  the sight of her husband, vivid in her gaze,\nthat her white arms, embracing his neck\nwould never for a moment let him go . . .\nDawn with her rose-red fingers might have shone\nupon their tears, if with her glinting eyes\nAthena had not thought of one more thing.\nShe held back the night, and night lingered long\nat the western edge of the earth, while in the east\nshe reined in Dawn of the golden throne at Ocean’s banks,\ncommanding her not to yoke the windswift team that brings men light,\n280  Blaze and Aurora, the young colts that race the Morning on.\nYet now Odysseus, seasoned veteran, said to his wife,\n“Dear woman . . . we have still not reached the end\nof all our trials. One more labor lies in store —\nboundless, laden with danger, great and long,\nand I must brave it out from start to finish.\nSo the ghost of Tiresias prophesied to me,\nthe day that I went down to the House of Death\nto learn our best route home, my comrades’ and my own.\nBut come, let’s go to bed, dear woman —at long last\n290  delight in sleep, delight in each other, come!”\n“If it’s bed you want,” reserved Penelope replied,\n“it’s bed you’ll have, whenever the spirit moves you,\nnow that the gods have brought you home again\nto native land, your grand and gracious house.\nBut since you’ve alluded to it,\nsince a god has put it in your mind,\nplease, tell me about this trial still to come.\nI’m bound to learn of it later, I am sure —\nwhat’s the harm if I hear of it tonight?”\n“Still so strange,”\n300  Odysseus, the old master of stories, answered.\n“Why again, why force me to tell you all?\nWell, tell I shall. I’ll hide nothing now.\nBut little joy it will bring you, I’m afraid,\nas little joy for me.\nThe prophet said\nthat I must rove through towns on towns of men,\nthat I must carry a well-planed oar until\nI come to a people who know nothing of the sea,\nwhose food is never seasoned with salt, strangers all\nto ships with their crimson prows and long slim oars,\n310  wings that make ships fly. And here is my sign,\nhe told me, clear, so clear I cannot miss it,\nand I will share it with you now . . .\nWhen another traveler falls in with me and calls\nthat weight across my shoulder a fan to winnow grain,\nthen, he told me, I must plant my oar in the earth\nand sacrifice fine beasts to the lord god of the sea,\nPoseidon —a ram, a bull and a ramping wild boar —\nthen journey home and render noble offerings up\nto the deathless gods who rule the vaulting skies,\n320  to all the gods in order.\nAnd at last my own death will steal upon me . . .\na gentle, painless death, far from the sea it comes\nto take me down, borne down with the years in ripe old age\nwith all my people here in blessed peace around me.\nAll this, the prophet said, will come to pass.”\n“And so,” Penelope said, in her great wisdom,\n“if the gods will really grant a happier old age,\nthere’s hope that we’ll escape our trials at last.”\nSo husband and wife confided in each other,\n330  while nurse and Eurynome, under the flaring brands,\nwere making up the bed with coverings deep and soft.\nAnd working briskly, soon as they’d made it snug,\nback to her room the old nurse went to sleep\nas Eurynome, their attendant, torch in hand,\nlighted the royal couple’s way to bed and,\nleading them to their chamber, slipped away.\nRejoicing in each other, they returned to their bed,\nthe old familiar place they loved so well.\nNow Telemachus, the cowherd and the swineherd\n340  rested their dancing feet and had the women do the same,\nand across the shadowed hall the men lay down to sleep.\nBut the royal couple, once they’d reveled in all\nthe longed-for joys of love, reveled in each other’s stories,\nthe radiant woman telling of all she’d borne at home,\nwatching them there, the infernal crowd of suitors\nslaughtering herds of cattle and good fat sheep —\nwhile keen to win her hand —\ndraining the broached vats dry of vintage wine.\nAnd great Odysseus told his wife of all the pains\n350  he had dealt out to other men and all the hardships\nhe’d endured himself —his story first to last —\nand she listened on, enchanted . . .\nSleep never sealed her eyes till all was told.\nHe launched in with how he fought the Cicones down,\nthen how he came to the Lotus-eaters’ lush green land.\nThen all the crimes of the Cyclops and how he paid him back\nfor the gallant men the monster ate without a qualm —\nthen how he visited Aeolus, who gave him a hero’s welcome\nthen he sent him off, but the homeward run was not his fate,\n360  not yet —some sudden squalls snatched him away once more\nand drove him over the swarming sea, groaning in despair.\nThen how he moored at Telepylus, where Laestrygonians\nwrecked his fleet and killed his men-at-arms.\nHe told her of Circe’s cunning magic wiles\nand how he voyaged down in his long benched ship\nto the moldering House of Death, to consult Tiresias,\nghostly seer of Thebes, and he saw old comrades there\nand he saw his mother, who bore and reared him as a child.\nHe told how he caught the Sirens’ voices throbbing in the wind\nand how he had scudded past the Clashing Rocks, past grim Charybdis,\npast Scylla —whom no rover had ever coasted by, home free —\nand how his shipmates slaughtered the cattle of the Sun\nand Zeus the king of thunder split his racing ship\nwith a reeking bolt and killed his hardy comrades,\nall his fighting men at a stroke, but he alone\nescaped their death at sea. He told how he reached\nOgygia’s shores and the nymph Calypso held him back,\ndeep in her arching caverns, craving him for a husband —\ncherished him, vowed to make him immortal, ageless, all his days,\n380  yes, but she never won the heart inside him, never . . .\nthen how he reached the Phaeacians —heavy sailing there —\nwho with all their hearts had prized him like a god\nand sent him off in a ship to his own beloved land,\ngiving him bronze and hoards of gold and robes . . .\nand that was the last he told her, just as sleep\novercame him . . . sleep loosing his limbs,\nslipping the toils of anguish from his mind.\nAthena, her eyes afire, had fresh plans.\nOnce she thought he’d had his heart’s content\n390  of love and sleep at his wife’s side, straightaway\nshe roused young Dawn from Ocean’s banks to her golden throne\nto bring men light and roused Odysseus too, who rose\nfrom his soft bed and advised his wife in parting,\n“Dear woman, we both have had our fill of trials.\nYou in our house, weeping over my journey home,\nfraught with storms and torment, true, and I,\npinned down in pain by Zeus and other gods,\nfor all my desire, blocked from reaching home.\nBut now that we’ve arrived at our bed together —\n400  the reunion that we yearned for all those years —\nlook after the things still left me in our house.\nBut as for the flocks those brazen suitors plundered,\nmuch I’ll recoup myself, making many raids;\nthe rest our fellow-Ithacans will supply\ntill all my folds are full of sheep again.\nBut now I must be off to the upland farm,\nour orchard green with trees, to see my father,\ngood old man weighed down with so much grief for me.\nAnd you, dear woman, sensible as you are,\n410  I would advise you, still . . .\nquick as the rising sun the news will spread\nof the suitors that I killed inside the house.\nSo climb to your lofty chamber with your women.\nSit tight there. See no one. Question no one.”\nHe strapped his burnished armor round his shoulders,\nroused Telemachus, the cowherd and the swineherd,\nand told them to take up weapons honed for battle.\nThey snapped to commands, harnessed up in bronze,\nopened the doors and strode out, Odysseus in the lead.\n420  By now the daylight covered the land, but Pallas,\nshrouding them all in darkness,\nquickly led the four men out of town."

You were fated to die a wretched death.”\nAnd the ghost of Atrides Agamemnon answered,\n“Son of Peleus, great godlike Achilles! Happy man,\nyou died on the fields of Troy, a world away from home,\n40  and the best of Trojan and Argive champions died around you,\nfighting for your corpse. And you . . . there you lay\nin the whirling dust, overpowered in all your power\nand wiped from memory all your horseman’s skills.\nThat whole day we fought, we’d never have stopped\nif Zeus had not stopped us with sudden gales.\nThen we bore you out of the fighting, onto the ships,\nwe laid you down on a litter, cleansed your handsome flesh\nwith warm water and soothing oils, and round your body\ntroops of Danaans wept hot tears and cut their locks.\nHearing the news, your mother, Thetis, rose from the sea,\nimmortal sea-nymphs in her wake, and a strange unearthly cry\ncame throbbing over the ocean. Terror gripped Achaea’s armies,\nthey would have leapt in panic, boarded the long hollow ships\nif one man, deep in his age-old wisdom, had not checked them:\nNestor —from the first his counsel always seemed the best,\nand now, concerned for the ranks, he rose and shouted,\n‘Hold fast, Argives! Sons of Achaea, don’t run now!\nThis is Achilles’ mother rising from the sea\nwith all her immortal sea-nymphs —\n60  she longs to join her son who died in battle!’\nThat stopped our panicked forces in their tracks\nas the Old Man of the Sea’s daughters gathered round you —\nwailing, heartsick —dressed you in ambrosial, deathless robes\nand the Muses, nine in all, voice-to-voice in choirs,\ntheir vibrant music rising, raised your dirge.\nNot one soldier would you have seen dry-eyed,\nthe Muses’ song so pierced us to the heart.\nFor seventeen days unbroken, days and nights\nwe mourned you —immortal gods and mortal men.\n70  At the eighteenth dawn we gave you to the flames\nand slaughtered around your body droves of fat sheep\nand shambling longhorn cattle, and you were burned\nin the garments of the gods and laved with soothing oils\nand honey running sweet, and a long cortege of Argive heroes\nparaded in review, in battle armor round your blazing pyre,\nmen in chariots, men on foot —a resounding roar went up.\nAnd once the god of fire had burned your corpse to ash,\nat first light we gathered your white bones, Achilles,\ncured them in strong neat wine and seasoned oils.\n80  Your mother gave us a gold two-handled urn,\na gift from Dionysus, she said,\na masterwork of the famous Smith, the god of fire.\nYour white bones rest in that, my brilliant Achilles,\nmixed with the bones of dead Patroclus, Menoetius’ son,\napart from those of Antilochus, whom you treasured\nmore than all other comrades once Patroclus died.\nOver your bones we reared a grand, noble tomb —\ndevoted veterans all, Achaea’s combat forces —\nhigh on its jutting headland over the Hellespont’s\n90  broad reach, a landmark glimpsed from far out at sea\nby men of our own day and men of days to come.\nyour mother, begging the gods for priceless trophies,\nset them out in the ring for all our champions.\nYou in your day have witnessed funeral games\nfor many heroes, games to honor the death of kings,\nwhen young men cinch their belts, tense to win some prize —\nbut if you’d laid eyes on these it would have thrilled your heart,\nmagnificent trophies the goddess, glistening-footed Thetis,\nheld out in your honor. You were dear to the gods,\n100  so even in death your name will never die . . .\nGreat glory is yours, Achilles,\nfor all time, in the eyes of all mankind!\nWhat joy for me when the coil of war had wound down?\nFor my return Zeus hatched a pitiful death\nat the hands of Aegisthus —and my accursed wife.”\nAs they exchanged the stories of their fates,\nHermes the guide and giant-killer drew up close to both,\nleading down the ghosts of the suitors King Odysseus killed.\nStruck by the sight, the two went up to them right away\n110  and the ghost of Atreus’ son Agamemnon recognized\nthe noted prince Amphimedon, Melaneus’ dear son\nwho received him once in Ithaca, at his home,\nand Atrides’ ghost called out to his old friend now,\n“Amphimedon, what disaster brings you down to the dark world?\nAll of you, good picked men, and all in your prime —\nno captain out to recruit the best in any city\ncould have chosen better. What laid you low?\nWrecked in the ships when lord Poseidon roused\nsome punishing blast of gales and heavy breakers?\n120  Or did ranks of enemies mow you down on land\nas you tried to raid and cut off herds and flocks\nor fought to win their city, take their women?\nAnswer me, tell me. I was once your guest.\nDon’t you recall the day I came to visit\nyour house in Ithaca —King Menelaus came too —\nto urge Odysseus to sail with us in the ships\non our campaign to Troy? And the long slow voyage,\ncrossing wastes of ocean, cost us one whole month.\nThat’s how hard it was to bring him round,\nOdysseus, raider of cities.”\n130                                “Famous Atrides!”\nAmphimedon’s ghost called back. “Lord of men, Agamemnon,\nI remember it all, your majesty, as you say,\nand I will tell you, start to finish now,\nthe story of our death,\nthe brutal end contrived to take us off.\nWe were courting the wife of Odysseus, gone so long.\nShe neither spurned nor embraced a marriage she despised,\nno, she simply planned our death, our black doom!\nThis was her latest masterpiece of guile:\n140  she set up a great loom in the royal halls\nand she began to weave, and the weaving finespun,\nthe yarns endless, and she would lead us on: ‘Young men,\nmy suitors, now that King Odysseus is no more,\ngo slowly, keen as you are to marry me, until\nI can finish off this web . . .\nso my weaving won’t all fray and come to nothing.\nThis is a shroud for old lord Laertes, for that day\nwhen the deadly fate that lays us out at last will take him down.\nI dread the shame my countrywomen would heap upon me,\n150  yes, if a man of such wealth should lie in state\nwithout a shroud for cover.’\nHer very words,\nand despite our pride and passion we believed her.\nSo by day she’d weave at her great and growing web —\nby night, by the light of torches set beside her,\nshe would unravel all she’d done. Three whole years\nshe deceived us blind, seduced us with this scheme . . .\nThen, when the wheeling seasons brought the fourth year on\nand the months waned and the long days came round once more,\none of her women, in on the queen’s secret, told the truth\n160  and we caught her in the act —unweaving her gorgeous web.\nSo she finished it off. Against her will. We forced her.\nBut just as she bound off that great shroud and washed it,\nspread it out —glistening like the sunlight or the moon —\njust then some wicked spirit brought Odysseus back,\nfrom god knows where, to the edge of his estate\nwhere the swineherd kept his pigs. And back too,\nto the same place, came Odysseus’ own dear son,\nscudding home in his black ship from sandy Pylos.\nThe pair of them schemed our doom, our deathtrap,\n170  then lit out for town —\nTelemachus first in fact, Odysseus followed,\nlater, led by the swineherd, and clad in tatters,\nlooking for all the world like an old and broken beggar\nhunched on a stick, his body wrapped in shameful rags.\nDisguised so none of us, not even the older ones,\ncould spot that tramp for the man he really was,\nbursting in on us there, out of the blue. No,\nwe attacked him, blows and insults flying fast,\nand he took it all for a time, in his own house,\n180  all the taunts and blows —he had a heart of iron.\nBut once the will of thundering Zeus had roused his blood,\nhe and Telemachus bore the burnished weapons off\nand stowed them deep in a storeroom, shot the bolts\nand he —the soul of cunning —told his wife to set\nthe great bow and the gleaming iron axes out\nbefore the suitors —all of us doomed now —\nto test our skill and bring our slaughter on . . .\nNot one of us had the strength to string that powerful weapon,\nall of us fell far short of what it took. But then,\n190  when the bow was coming round to Odysseus’ hands,\nwe raised a hue and cry —he must not have it,\nno matter how he begged! Only Telemachus\nurged him to take it up, and once he got it\nin his clutches, long-suffering great Odysseus\nstrung his bow with ease and shot through all the axes,\nthen, vaulting onto the threshold, stood there poised, and pouring\nhis flashing arrows out before him, glaring for the kill,\nhe cut Antinous down, then shot his painful arrows\ninto the rest of us, aiming straight and true,\n200  and down we went, corpse on corpse in droves.\nClearly a god was driving him and all his henchmen,\nrouting us headlong in their fury down the hall,\nwheeling into the slaughter, slashing left and right\nand grisly screams broke from skulls cracked open —\nthe whole floor awash with blood.\nSo we died,\nAgamemnon . . . our bodies lie untended even now,\nstrewn in Odysseus’ palace. They know nothing yet,\nthe kin in our houses who might wash our wounds\nof clotted gore and lay us out and mourn us.\nThese are the solemn honors owed the dead.”\n“Happy Odysseus!”\nAgamemnon’s ghost cried out. “Son of old Laertes —\nmastermind —what a fine, faithful wife you won!\nWhat good sense resided in your Penelope —\nhow well Icarius’ daughter remembered you,\nOdysseus, the man she married once!\nThe fame of her great virtue will never die.\nThe immortal gods will lift a song for all mankind,\na glorious song in praise of self-possessed Penelope.\nA far cry from the daughter of Tyndareus, Clytemnestra —\n220  what outrage she committed, killing the man she married once! —\nyes, and the song men sing of her will ring with loathing.\nShe brands with a foul name the breed of womankind,\neven the honest ones to come!”\nSo they traded stories,\nthe two ghosts standing there in the House of Death,\nfar in the hidden depths below the earth.\nOdysseus and his men had stridden down from town\nand quickly reached Laertes’ large, well-tended farm\nthat the old king himself had wrested from the wilds,\nyears ago, laboring long and hard. His lodge was here\n230  and around it stretched a row of sheds where fieldhands,\nbondsmen who did his bidding, sat and ate and slept.\nAnd an old Sicilian woman was in charge,\nwho faithfully looked after her aged master\nout on his good estate remote from town.\nOdysseus told his servants and his son,\n“Into the timbered lodge now, go, quickly,\nkill us the fattest porker, fix our meal.\nAnd I will put my father to the test,\nsee if the old man knows me now, on sight,\n240  or fails to, after twenty years apart.”\nWith that he passed his armor to his men\nand in they went at once, his son as well. Odysseus\nwandered off, approaching the thriving vineyard, searching,\npicking his way down to the great orchard, searching,\nbut found neither Dolius nor his sons nor any hand.\nThey’d just gone off, old Dolius in the lead,\nto gather stones for a dry retaining wall\nto shore the vineyard up. But he did find\nhis father, alone, on that well-worked plot,\n250  spading round a sapling —clad in filthy rags,\nin a patched, unseemly shirt, and round his shins\nhe had some oxhide leggings strapped, patched too,\nto keep from getting scraped, and gloves on his hands\nto fight against the thorns, and on his head\nhe wore a goatskin skullcap\nto cultivate his misery that much more . . .\nLong-enduring Odysseus, catching sight of him now —\na man worn down with years, his heart racked with sorrow —\nhalted under a branching pear-tree, paused and wept.\n260  Debating, head and heart, what should he do now?\nKiss and embrace his father, pour out the long tale —\nhow he had made the journey home to native land —\nor probe him first and test him every way?\nTorn, mulling it over, this seemed better:\ntest the old man first,\nreproach him with words that cut him to the core.\nConvinced, Odysseus went right up to his father.\nLaertes was digging round the sapling, head bent low\nas his famous offspring hovered over him and began,\n270  “You want no skill, old man, at tending a garden.\nAll’s well-kept here; not one thing in the plot,\nno plant, no fig, no pear, no olive, no vine,\nnot a vegetable, lacks your tender, loving care.\nBut I must say —and don’t be offended now —\nyour plants are doing better than yourself.\nEnough to be stooped with age\nbut look how squalid you are, those shabby rags.\nSurely it’s not for sloth your master lets you go to seed.\nThere’s nothing of slave about your build or bearing.\n280  I have eyes: you look like a king to me. The sort\nentitled to bathe, sup well, then sleep in a soft bed.\nThat’s the right and pride of you old-timers.\nCome now, tell me —in no uncertain terms —\nwhose slave are you? whose orchard are you tending?\nAnd tell me this —I must be absolutely sure —\nthis place I’ve reached, is it truly Ithaca?\nJust as that fellow told me, just now . . .\nI fell in with him on the road here. Clumsy,\nnone too friendly, couldn’t trouble himself\n290  to hear me out or give me a decent answer\nwhen I asked about a long-lost friend of mine,\nwhether he’s still alive, somewhere in Ithaca,\nor dead and gone already, lost in the House of Death.\nDo you want to hear his story? Listen. Catch my drift.\nI once played host to a man in my own country;\nhe’d come to my door, the most welcome guest\nfrom foreign parts I ever entertained.\nHe claimed he came of good Ithacan stock,\nsaid his father was Arcesius’ son, Laertes.\n300  So I took the new arrival under my own roof,\nI gave him a hero’s welcome, treated him in style —\nstores in our palace made for princely entertainment.\nAnd I gave my friend some gifts to fit his station,\nhanded him seven bars of well-wrought gold,\na mixing-bowl of solid silver, etched with flowers,\na dozen cloaks, unlined and light, a dozen rugs\nand as many full-cut capes and shirts as well,\nand to top it off, four women, perfect beauties\nskilled in crafts —he could pick them out himself.”\n310    “Stranger,” his father answered, weeping softly,\n“the land you’ve reached is the very one you’re after,\ntrue, but it’s in the grip of reckless, lawless men.\nAnd as for the gifts you showered on your guest,\nyou gave them all for nothing.\nBut if you’d found him alive, here in Ithaca,\nhe would have replied in kind, with gift for gift,\nand entertained you warmly before he sent you off.\nThat’s the old custom, when one has led the way.\nBut tell me, please —in no uncertain terms —\n320  how many years ago did you host the man,\nthat unfortunate guest of yours, my son . . .\nthere was a son, or was he all a dream?\nThat most unlucky man, whom now, I fear,\nfar from his own soil and those he loves,\nthe fish have swallowed down on the high seas\nor birds and beasts on land have made their meal.\nNor could the ones who bore him —mother, father —\nwrap his corpse in a shroud and mourn him deeply.\nNor could his warm, generous wife, so self-possessed,\n330  Penelope, ever keen for her husband on his deathbed,\nthe fit and proper way, or close his eyes at last.\nThese are the solemn honors owed the dead.\nBut tell me your own story —that I’d like to know:\nWho are you? where are you from? your city? your parents?\nWhere does the ship lie moored that brought you here,\nyour hardy shipmates too? Or did you arrive\nas a passenger aboard some stranger’s craft\nand men who put you ashore have pulled away?”\n“The whole tale,”\nhis crafty son replied, “I’ll tell you start to finish.\nI come from Roamer-Town, my home’s a famous place,\nmy father’s Unsparing, son of old King Pain,\nand my name’s Man of Strife . . .\nI sailed from Sicily, aye, but some ill wind\nblew me here, off course —much against my will —\nand my ship lies moored off farmlands far from town.\nAs for Odysseus, well, five years have passed\nsince he left my house and put my land behind him,\nluckless man! But the birds were good as he launched out,\nall on the right, and I rejoiced as I sent him off\n350  and he rejoiced in sailing. We had high hopes\nwe’d meet again as guests, as old friends,\nand trade some shining gifts.”\nAt those words\na black cloud of grief came shrouding over Laertes.\nBoth hands clawing the ground for dirt and grime,\nhe poured it over his grizzled head, sobbing, in spasms.\nOdysseus’ heart shuddered, a sudden twinge went shooting up\nthrough his nostrils, watching his dear father struggle . . .\nHe sprang toward him, kissed him, hugged him, crying,\n“Father —I am your son —myself, the man you’re seeking,\n360  home after twenty years, on native ground at last!\nHold back your tears, your grief.\nLet me tell you the news, but we must hurry —\nI’ve cut the suitors down in our own house,\nI’ve paid them back their outrage, vicious crimes!”\n“Odysseus . . .”\nLaertes, catching his breath, found words to answer.\n“You —you’re truly my son, Odysseus, home at last?\nGive me a sign, some proof —I must be sure.”\n“This scar first,”\nquick to the mark, his son said, “look at this —\nthe wound I took from the boar’s white tusk\n370  on Mount Parnassus. There you’d sent me, you\nand mother, to see her fond old father, Autolycus,\nand collect the gifts he vowed to give me, once,\nwhen he came to see us here.\nOr these, these trees —\nlet me tell you the trees you gave me years ago,\nhere on this well-worked plot . . .\nI begged you for everything I saw, a little boy\ntrailing you through the orchard, picking our way\namong these trees, and you named them one by one.\nYou gave me thirteen pear, ten apple trees\n380  and forty figs —and promised to give me, look,\nfifty vinerows, bearing hard on each other’s heels,\nclusters of grapes year-round at every grade of ripeness,\nmellowed as Zeus’s seasons weigh them down.”\nLiving proof —\nand Laertes’ knees went slack, his heart surrendered,\nrecognizing the strong clear signs Odysseus offered.\nHe threw his arms around his own dear son, fainting\nas hardy great Odysseus hugged him to his heart\nuntil he regained his breath, came back to life\nand cried out, “Father Zeus —\n390  you gods of Olympus, you still rule on high\nif those suitors have truly paid in blood\nfor all their reckless outrage! Oh, but now\nmy heart quakes with fear that all the Ithacans\nwill come down on us in a pack, at any time,\nand rush the alarm through every island town!”\n“There’s nothing to fear,” his canny son replied,\n“put it from your mind. Let’s make for your lodge\nbeside the orchard here. I sent Telemachus on ahead,\nthe cowherd, swineherd too, to fix a hasty meal.”\n400    So the two went home, confiding all the way\nand arriving at the ample, timbered lodge,\nthey found Telemachus with the two herdsmen\ncarving sides of meat and mixing ruddy wine.\nBefore they ate, the Sicilian serving-woman\nbathed her master, Laertes —his spirits high\nin his own room —and rubbed him down with oil\nand round his shoulders drew a fresh new cloak.\nAnd Athena stood beside him, fleshing out the limbs\nof the old commander, made him taller to all eyes,\n410  his build more massive, stepping from his bath,\nso his own son gazed at him, wonderstruck —\nface-to-face he seemed a deathless god . . .\n“Father” —Odysseus’ words had wings —“surely\none of the everlasting gods has made you\ntaller, stronger, shining in my eyes!”\nFacing his son, the wise old man returned,\n“If only —Father Zeus, Athena and lord Apollo —\nI were the man I was, king of the Cephallenians\nwhen I sacked the city of Nericus, sturdy fortress\n420  out on its jutting cape! If I’d been young in arms\nlast night in our house with harness on my back,\nstanding beside you, fighting off the suitors,\nhow many I would have cut the knees from under —\nthe heart inside you would have leapt for joy!”\nSo father and son confirmed each other’s spirits.\nAnd then, with the roasting done, the meal set out,\nthe others took their seats on chairs and stools,\nwere just putting their hands to bread and meat\nwhen old Dolius trudged in with his sons,\n430  worn out from the fieldwork.\nThe old Sicilian had gone and fetched them home,\nthe mother who reared the boys and tended Dolius well,\nnow that the years had ground the old man down . . .\nWhen they saw Odysseus —knew him in their bones —\nthey stopped in their tracks, staring, struck dumb,\nbut the king waved them on with a warm and easy air:\n“Sit down to your food, old friend. Snap out of your wonder.\nWe’ve been cooling our heels here long enough,\neager to get our hands on all this pork,\n440  hoping you’d all troop in at any moment.”\nSpreading his arms, Dolius rushed up to him,\nclutched Odysseus by the wrist and kissed his hand,\ngreeting his king now with a burst of winging words:\n“Dear master, you’re back —the answer to our prayers!\nWe’d lost all hope but the gods have brought you home!\nWelcome —health! The skies rain blessings on you!\nBut tell me the truth now —this I’d like to know —\nshrewd Penelope, has she heard you’re home?\nOr should we send a messenger?”\n“She knows by now,\n450  old man,” his wily master answered brusquely.\n“Why busy yourself with that?”\nSo Dolius went back to his sanded stool.\nHis sons too, pressing around the famous king,\ngreeted Odysseus warmly, grasped him by the hand\nthen took their seats in order by their father.\nBut now, as they fell to supper in the lodge,\nRumor the herald sped like wildfire through the city,\ncrying out the news of the suitors’ bloody death and doom,\nand massing from every quarter as they listened, kinsmen milled\n460  with wails and moans of grief before Odysseus’ palace.\nAnd then they carried out the bodies, every family\nburied their own, and the dead from other towns\nthey loaded onto the rapid ships for crews\nto ferry back again, each to his own home . . .\nThen in a long, mourning file they moved to assembly\nwhere, once they’d grouped, crowding the meeting grounds,\nold lord Eupithes rose in their midst to speak out.\nUnforgettable sorrow wrung his heart for his son,\nAntinous, the first that great Odysseus killed.\n470  In tears for the one he lost, he stood and cried,\n“My friends, what a mortal blow this man has dealt\nto all our island people! Those fighters, many and brave,\nhe led away in his curved ships —he lost the ships\nand he lost the men and back he comes again\nto kill the best of our Cephallenian princes.\nQuick, after him! Before he flees to Pylos\nor holy Elis, where Epeans rule in power —\nup, attack! Or we’ll hang our heads forever,\nall disgraced, even by generations down the years,\n480  if we don’t punish the murderers of our brothers and our sons!\nWhy, life would lose its relish —for me, at least —\nI’d rather die at once and go among the dead.\nAttack! —before the assassins cross the sea\nand leave us in their wake.”\nHe closed in tears\nand compassion ran through every Achaean there.\nSuddenly Medon and the inspired bard approached them,\nfresh from Odysseus’ house, where they had just awakened.\nThey strode into the crowds; amazement took each man\nbut the herald Medon spoke in all his wisdom:\n490  “Hear me, men of Ithaca. Not without the hand\nof the deathless gods did Odysseus do these things!\nMyself, I saw an immortal fighting at his side —\nlike Mentor to the life. I saw the same god,\nnow in front of Odysseus, spurring him on,\nnow stampeding the suitors through the hall,\ncrazed with fear, and down they went in droves!”\nTerror gripped them all, their faces ashen white.\nAt last the old warrior Halitherses, Mastor’s son —\nwho alone could see the days behind and days ahead —\n500  rose up and spoke, distraught for each man there:\n“Hear me, men of Ithaca. Hear what I have to say.\nThanks to your own craven hearts these things were done!\nYou never listened to me or the good commander Mentor,\nyou never put a stop to your sons’ senseless folly.\nWhat fine work they did, so blind, so reckless,\ncarving away the wealth, affronting the wife\nof a great and famous man, telling themselves\nthat he’d return no more! So let things rest now.\nListen to me for once —I say don’t attack!\nElse some will draw the lightning on their necks.”\n510                                                      So he urged\nand some held fast to their seats, but more than half\nsprang up with warcries now. They had no taste\nfor the prophet’s sane plan —winning Eupithes\nquickly won them over. They ran for armor\nand once they’d harnessed up in burnished bronze\nthey grouped in ranks before the terraced city.\nEupithes led them on in their foolish, mad campaign,\ncertain he would avenge the slaughter of his son\nbut the father was not destined to return —\n520  he’d meet his death in battle then and there.\nAthena at this point made appeals to Zeus:\n“Father, son of Cronus, our high and mighty king,\nnow let me ask you a question . . .\ntell me the secrets hidden in your mind.\nWill you prolong the pain, the cruel fighting here\nor hand down pacts of peace between both sides?”\n“My child,” Zeus who marshals the thunderheads replied,\n“why do you pry and probe me so intently? Come now,\nwasn’t the plan your own? You conceived it yourself:\n530  Odysseus should return and pay the traitors back.\nDo as your heart desires —\nbut let me tell you how it should be done.\nNow that royal Odysseus has taken his revenge,\nlet both sides seal their pacts that he shall reign for life,\nand let us purge their memories of the bloody slaughter\nof their brothers and their sons. Let them be friends,\ndevoted as in the old days. Let peace and wealth\ncome cresting through the land.”\nSo Zeus decreed\nand launched Athena already poised for action —\n540  down she swept from Olympus’ craggy peaks.\nBy then Odysseus’ men had had their fill\nof hearty fare, and the seasoned captain said,\n“One of you go outside —see if they’re closing in.”\nA son of Dolius snapped to his command,\nran to the door and saw them all too close\nand shouted back to Odysseus,\n“They’re on top of us! To arms —and fast!”\nUp they sprang and strapped themselves in armor,\nthe three men with Odysseus, Dolius’ six sons\n550  and Dolius and Laertes clapped on armor too,\ngray as they were, but they would fight if forced.\nOnce they had all harnessed up in burnished bronze\nthey opened the doors and strode out, Odysseus in the lead.\nAnd now, taking the build and voice of Mentor,\nZeus’s daughter Athena marched right in.\nThe good soldier Odysseus thrilled to see her,\nturned to his son and said in haste, “Telemachus,\nyou’ll learn soon enough —as you move up to fight\nwhere champions strive to prove themselves the best —\n560  not to disgrace your father’s line a moment.\nIn battle prowess we’ve excelled for ages\nall across the world.”\nTelemachus reassured him,\n“Now you’ll see, if you care to watch, father,\nnow I’m fired up. Disgrace, you say?\nI won’t disgrace your line!”\nLaertes called out in deep delight,\n“What a day for me, dear gods! What joy —\nmy son and my grandson vying over courage!”\nGoddess Athena rushed beside him, eyes ablaze:\n570  “Son of Arcesius, dearest of all my comrades,\nsay a prayer to the bright-eyed girl and Father Zeus,\nthen brandish your long spear and wing it fast!”\nAthena breathed enormous strength in the old man.\nHe lifted a prayer to mighty Zeus’s daughter,\nbrandished his spear a moment, winged it fast\nand hit Eupithes, pierced his bronze-sided helmet\nthat failed to block the bronze point tearing through —\ndown Eupithes crashed, his armor clanging against his chest.\nOdysseus and his gallant son charged straight at the front lines,\n580  slashing away with swords, with two-edged spears and now\nthey would have killed them all, cut them off from home\nif Athena, daughter of storming Zeus, had not cried out\nin a piercing voice that stopped all fighters cold,\n“Hold back, you men of Ithaca, back from brutal war!\nBreak off —shed no more blood —make peace at once!”\nSo Athena commanded. Terror blanched their faces,\nthey went limp with fear, weapons slipped from their hands\nand strewed the ground at the goddess’ ringing voice.\nThey spun in flight to the city, wild to save their lives,\n590  but loosing a savage cry, the long-enduring great Odysseus,\ngathering all his force, swooped like a soaring eagle —\njust as the son of Cronus hurled a reeking bolt\nthat fell at her feet, the mighty Father’s daughter,\nand blazing-eyed Athena wheeled on Odysseus, crying,\n“Royal son of Laertes, Odysseus, master of exploits,\nhold back now! Call a halt to the great leveler, War —\ndon’t court the rage of Zeus who rules the world!”\nSo she commanded. He obeyed her, glad at heart.\nAnd Athena handed down her pacts of peace\n600  between both sides for all the years to come —\nthe daughter of Zeus whose shield is storm and thunder,\nyes, but the goddess still kept Mentor’s build and voice."
